	//Make sure that when it acquires a target that it tries to stay within ~40 blocks of it
	//This will make sure it's easier to keep track of as well as ensure that you can do certain phases of it's AI without worrying about it's location
	
	//Stats
	//Health: 6000
	//Attack (normal hit): 16
	//Damage (slow-moving projectile): 8 armor-piercing
	//Damage (annhilator beam): 1000 armor-piercing, this might make it viable to use in a mob battle against other mobs
	//Speed: 0.223 (invulnerable mode), 0.375 (flying speed), 0.425 (ghost mode speed)
	//knockback resistance: 0 (can be knocked away and towards things)
	//Armor value: 24 (maximum value so that the strongest weapons are required)
	//Follow Range: 64
	
	//Description of AI:
	//Floats around near it's target and fires large slow moving projectiles that can pass through walls, these projectiles will also inflict the Hacked effect
	//While invulnerable it only does this part of it's AI
	//If "damaged" enough it'll become stunned for a long period of time, this is to allow you to escape it for a while to actually do stuff in the Dimension
	
	//When a spirit catcher is used on it, it becomes vulnerable
	//It'll then teleport away (despawn) and drop an Administrator passcode
	
	//When you enter the Dimension it'll already be vulnerable
	//While in this phase it'll spawn in control towers that shock you when you get near them randomly
	//You must "mine" these towers, causing them to overload at which point they'll make the Admin vulnerable for a little while
	//You continue this until it's health is lowered, it's health will only stay lowered if you do enough damage during a phase, otherwise you must redo it
	//This will take it's health down to half when completed, each tower phase will take 1/6th of it's total health and it'll remove the towers during each
	//of these
	
	//When you successfully overload and damage it 3 times, it'll become separated from it's body module (which will stay in place during this phase)
	//It will gain an instakill beam that has a long charge rate, it'll become fixed on one point and fire the beam after a few seconds, instantly killing
	//anything within it
	//To damage it in this phase, you must use the towers it left behind to "shock" it with Directed Lightning, this will need to be done until it's dropped
	//down to no health in which it goes into sleep mode, at certain phases in this pattern it'll go into recovery mode and attempt to regenerate health,
	//it must be attacked normally at this time to prevent that
	//also at certain phases it'll create a singularity which will alter your active effects and change your current health and hunger amounts, in other words,
	//it'll basically hack your stats (won't affect inventory and current equipped items but the effects will actually occur
	
	//New block, it'll have three states, one active and one inactive similarly to how I originally wanted to do the Digital Sea and one "broken"
	//The broken block state will signify that part of the tower has been destroyed, there will also be core states
	//core states will be in the middle of the tower, if an active block is not touching a core block it'll become inactive
	
	//Sounds will be referencing Windows notifications ("Your computer is about to restart to finish installing updates", "Powering down...", "Powering up.",
	//"That command does not exist", "File not found in database, would you like to continue? Y/N?", "No files match search query", etc.)
	//"That file is corrupted, would you like to attempt recovery?", "Memory allocation is inadequate for this operation.", "Doing this requires you to power off
	//your computer", "System32 has been restored, that was close."
	//Could have one set of male and one set of female-ish sounds (since I would be recording both), this could be determined on spawn if male or female voice
	//Move to a "corrupt" set of the same sounds when in "ghost" form
