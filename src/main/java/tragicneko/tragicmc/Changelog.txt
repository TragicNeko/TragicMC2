Full Complete Changelog:

This is updated for EVERY little thing I do/change to this mod
This also keeps track of my ideas so if you read this and steal some, make sure to at least credit me for it, thanks

Alpha:
v0.1:
Started creating basic items, blocks aren't registering properly though
Created all of the Tool Materials, Armor Materials and Creature Attributes I'm planning on using currently
Added a LOT of configuration options, this should also help with debugging any game crashes and such as well for the end user so that'll help
with better crash/bug reports hopefully

v0.2:
Started creating all of the Forge event hooks that this mod will use, Potion, Enchantment, Corruption, Achievement, Sound, etc.
Began framework for the Tragic Mobs, Mini-Bosses, Guardians, Bosses
Tragic Mobs = all of the normal mobs, including variants
Mini-Bosses = any normal mob that evolves due to corruption, some bosses will fit in this tier as roaming bosses
Guardians = any boss that spawns in a structure
Alphas = a very strong boss that usually has it's own dimension

v0.3:
Started specializing some of the basic armor/tool sets
Mercury tool set will have a random chance to break on each use (very rarely), the dagger has a chance to inflict strong poison on the target
The armor will also have a chance to break on each hit, but it will come pre-enchanted with toxicity 1 and you'll gain immunity while wearing
the full set
Tungsten Sabre will come pre-enchanted with fire aspect 1, tungsten jack will come pre-enchanted with combustion (if I can get it to work)
The armor will come pre-enchanted with Burn 1 and you will gain fire resistance while you're wearing the full set
Hunter Knife will be throwable and will come with range 1, when thrown it can always be picked back up unless it lands in lava or in the void
The armor will come pre-enchanted with lightweight 1 and agility 1, you will be slightly hidden from beast mobs with it on (they have a chance
to ignore you as a target, but only for a while)

v0.4:
Working on simplifying renders for the mobs, making you able to toggle low and high resolution textures, and also working on using a custom
spawn egg again
I'll now start using a build system for each version, this will only be used by me for ease of reference, I'm going to keep using the version
numbers I have been for releases, I'm going to add 1.7.2- to the front of each of this version's release and 1.6.4- for each of the old version
(of course), I'll add build numbers only for internal use, this will be also shown in the mcmod.info file and in the version number that forge
shows (This changelog will be stretched out more because of this, but it'll also allow me to see when/where changes were made and allow for 
ease of future reference in case I need to check this for some reason, 0.0.5 Alpha will be the first to use the new build system
Need to add a creative tab soon

v0.5.3:
Corrected the lang file (it wasn't reading the first line for some reason)
Added the first armor set with cleaned up code from the previous version, along with a couple of other basic items
Also adjusted the armor ratings and removed the plan for redundant items such as Troll Bones and Minotaur Hide
Added framework for converting most of the Sentry Mobs into Amulets, which are being retooled to be a use-one-at-a-time kind of thing that
has each one giving certain special abilities or buffs
Also working on fixing a problem with the Wraith not targeting the player, even when it is attacked by them
Convert Scythe to an item tool that extends ItemShear, with a sword's damage vs. entities

v0.5.7:
Added some textures (16 and 32x)
Changed Scythe to a tool/weapon and added crafting recipes for the skull armor and scythe
Added crafting recipes for the charms
Added texture for the Awakening stone, along with the crafting recipe
Slightly edited texture for the Skull armor (the actual rendered armor) and added textures for the armor items themselves
Added a 32x texture for the actual rendered Skull armor (it took FOREVER to draw, but it looks pretty awesome, too bad it's a weak armor)

v0.5.8
Restructured versioning
Minotaur will drop Horns, the Apis will drop a new item, maybe a Ankh as that is what the Egyptian god Apis had on it's horns in the mythology
Troll will probably be cut, it's attacks may be used on something else
Will add world generation that reduces the amount of vanilla ores that spawn (not counting emerald and diamond), this is to reduce the overabundance of common
ores such as redstone, coal and iron, but will also slightly reduce gold as well
World generation should be the next thing to add to the mod so I can get structures done as quickly as possible since I wasn't able to add them to the 1.6
version

v0.5.10
Added world gen to cut down the amount of vanilla ores that spawn, will need to test this out though to ensure that it doesn't cut them down
too much, just enough that it's a noticeable reduction, but not enough to make them all rare
Test resulted in barely any change in ore generation of vanilla ores, may need to adjust it to do what the emerald ore does to generate, 
however, I can't find the world gen for it currently
Still doing testing for cutting down vanilla ore generation, could possibly use a forge hook/event for this, I'll have to research it some

v0.5.15
Added a couple of armor sets with their one weapon, still need to add the Hunter's Bow
Fixed problem with the Wraith not attacking (had one of it's attack tasks in the wrong spot)
Added a few mob drops, added recipes for the Life Water that yields spawn eggs however, the Wither and End Dragon ones may be broken currently
I may remove the End Dragon one just because I feel like it should still be a one time boss fight (and I can always add it as a mob in one of
the custom dimensions, the Fallen King could possibly ride it as well)
Also changed percentages of the Wraith's various drops to be more effective
Added villager trades for Ruby/Sapphire, this is a test so we'll see how it goes (will have to spawn in a lot of villagers to test)

v0.5.17
There is a pathfinding problem with mobs that use the attack on collide ai (they pathfind too slowly so are very easy to dodge)
Test with villager trading was successful (finally a successful test)
Learned I need to create an ItemBlock to use Blocks, also may need to create a world generator for a new Biome, another thing is that I need
to change the spawn egg registration because it's not working properly either (it's making testing mobs difficult)
Added a block, removed spawn egg because it was causing the game crashes when I looked at the creative tab

v0.5.19
Converted the textureRes boolean into a String that details which texture should be loaded (preparation for when I actually add 64x ones)
The string will be "Low" 16x, "Mid" 32x , "High" 64x, the reason for this is to allow better fit when you're using a resource pack with this
installed
Added a KeyBinding in preparation for Specials for weapons, I'm going to try to only do one or two specials for each weapon, they will have
cooldowns for the better specials, the weaker ones will not have cooldowns, I'll probably add another keybinding in case I want 3 or more on
one weapon, the current keybinding is set to R
Converted all current texture file names to the new format, this includes the Wraith's texture (as it's the only mob currently)
I'll add a new weapon with a special to test out the keybinding, or just add one to one that's already been added
Next thing to test will be the corruption with mobs, so I'm going to add the Plague as the next mob, it'll probably have an "invisible" model
and will have a lot of particles coming out of it to show it's location, it should be hard to hit but easy to kill (like the wisp)

v0.5.23
Added a few new items, along with 16 and 32x textures
Added a lot of crafting recipes, mostly those for the Hunter armor set
Added the Hunter's Bow, right now it works exactly the same as a normal bow, so I'll have to change it later on to do slightly more damage or
to increase the speed at which the arrow flies, may also need to change the max damage it can have as well (has to be higher than 500, which
is what the normal bow has)
Added 16x textures for the Hunter armor, not for the actual rendered one though
Gawked at the 32x textures for a bit (lulz)
Still need to test the keybinding for use with the Ender Sword (I added it in for testing purposes), currently it's not possible to test what
block a ray trace hits, but it is possible to get the side hit so I may just let it teleport you regardless of if you'll get stuck [or I may
have it test whether that is a valid spot for your model to be able to be in and do that as the check, it'll be a bit finicky though])

v0.6.30 [Code restructure: Moved each class of items into it's own intilization class]
Moved a lot of code out of the main mod file for better readability and to not make the main mod file overclustered (like the previous version)
This is going to make each item, potion, etc to have a different directory to point to, but should be fine (it's not much of a change from having
to type TragicItems instead of TragicMC, or TragicBlocks instead of TragicMC)
Some things are kept in the main mod file, such as all of the config options, all of the entity registrations are done there as well
Started testing the key binding with the Ender Sword, it works correctly but the actual effect I had in mind for the Ender Sword doesn't work,
I wanted it to teleport whatever mob you're looking at to a different location but it doesn't seem to work, may need to use the RightClickEntity
method instead for that
While on the topic of the  Ender Sword, I changed the suffocation check to check if the player's bounding box would fit in the teleport location
before attempting the teleport, this should work as well, if not better than the previous check I had in place
I'll have to learn how to use the Netty chat system too, especially with things like special cooldown to tell the player how much cooldown time
is left

v0.6.32
Added a nullcheck in with the villager trading to ensure that mobs only mode is off so that it doesn't cause game crashes
The keybinding was successful, so it'll remain, I may make more uses for this, for instance if the player uses with a full armor set on and
an empty hand, they could initiate a berserker mode that makes you do more damage with no weapons in your hand (hold special while attacking with
armor set on) or they could jump really high up (hold special while jumping with full armor set on), or maybe iniate a Frenzy and give
themselves resistance 1 and strength 1 for a minute or so and inflict nausea on everything else around you (hold special with nothing in your
hand and your health below half)
These could be some nice non-amulet/weapon specials for the better armor sets
All of the specials will have some kind of balance, some more riskier to use than others, such as a chance for the special to fail an damage you
or have it reduce your health by a random (small) amount when you use it, or just have it have a chance to drain your hunger or inflict a bad
potion effect on you, these would be handled on a special-by-special basis though, so some would be intentionally unbalanced in a good way as
a balancing factor for the difficulty to obtain them

v0.6.34
Testing ore world gen, apparently the chance of ore to generate has been lowered A LOT but vanilla ores still generate way too much (in my
opinion) so I'll still look into reducing the vanilla ore spawn rates, however, I'll begin to test ore gen rates of my ores as well
Added the other 3 ores, no textures (need to use the right func for the texture anyway)

v0.6.41
Slightly changed all 5 ore gens, they should now be almost exactly how I want, but we'll see when I add more content
Added Achievements, Achievement Page and Creative Tabs
Moved all current items/blocks to the main creative tab, the mob one will be unused until I can get the spawn egg to work correctly
Will work on first achievement being obtainable, nevermind, it is obtainable already (tested just now)
Fixed language registrations, registered Achievement Page (forgot to do that)
Changed all of the armor sets to the proper creative tab

v0.6.45
Slightly changed Ender Sword, this is preparation for future weapon/item creation
Added more properties to the blocks (now I need to test them and tweak them)
Added smelting recipes for Mercury and Tungsten Ores
Added old textures for the Mercury and Tungsten ores, these will be changed
Added harvest levels to the blocks, set Ruby to require a diamond pickaxe (or equivalent) to mine
Currently silk touch works with the blocks, but fortune doesn't work with Ruby or Sapphire (this is a small problem so not that big of a deal)

v0.6.46
Will be releasing the last version of the previous mod later today or tomorrow, if I add enough content to this version before then, I may
release an alpha test version
Added old textures for Ruby and Sapphire ores (low res)

v0.6.47
Added a few enchantments, still need to give them their abilities/effects

v0.6.51
Added combustion enchantment, got it working correctly, just need to get the particles to spawn correctly
Also added ability for fortune to increase the drops when combined with combustion, need to add the ability of fortune to increase drops from
Ruby and Sapphire ores still
Added luck enchantment effect, now a 1 in 1000 chance of gaining experience randomly while wearing something with luck on it, this should be
a rare enchantment that you can only obtain from books while exploring/looting random chests or as a random drop from a tough boss/mob
Began attempting to add Range, it'd be a very nice thing to have, and I've been wanting to implement it for a while, but it may not be doable
with my current programming knowledge (it could be easy to do I just don't know how)

0.6.52
Can't get the Range enchantment to work, I may need to just do a ray trace when the player attacks, and get if the target is within a certain
range, that the attack is successful, I'm thinking only adding 1 block per level for the range, with it maxing at 2, meaning a maximum range
of around 6.5 blocks (which is a good distance)
Going to work on the multiply enchantment now, it should copy the arrow that was fired and should fly at a slightly different trajectory or
a slightly different starting position, I'm thinking slightly to the left or right of where the player actually shot the arrow with a slightly
varied trajectory of the multiplied arrows, this only has one level of enchantment and will make two copies of the arrow fired

0.6.54
Got Multiply to work correctly, it should also copy other enchantments on to the copied arrows, however, the copied arrows will do less damage
and have very little knockback
Now I'm going to work on adding potion effects

0.6.56
Removed player damage when corruption is active, for some reason it causes a game crash
Added ability to spread corruption if you are corrupted
Worked on adding Range again, nearly got it to work, but it's laden in game crashes and null pointer exceptions so I'll shelve it again

0.6.58
Added all of the potion effects, only added the actual effect for Flight and Aqua Superiority
NOTE: Mark this mod as a Survival Single Player mod as I don't think I'll have the time to test thoroughly for Server playthroughs with it,
and I'm not very experienced with doing client-server packet handling to do anything that extraordinary
I will now attempt to add a small GUI for the amulet armor slot I wanted to do, this will be a complete learning experience and I'll probably
just have amulets able to be stored in the gui's inventory space (so you don't need to have them in storage somewhere else when you need them),
I will also maybe create a rare item that allows you to have more than one amulet on at a time, with some restrictions of course, this may be
a difficult to craft item that opens up one slot for each use, for a maximum of 3 amulet slots
It would look something like this:

|    |x|     | x x x x x x
| |x|   |x|  | x x x x x x

3 amulet slots on the left, start with only one, unlock the other two, the slots on the right are for amulet storage, as you use amulets they
lose power and must be recharged (like how I did the Everlasting Light, except these would recover when they're not active and would lose their
power way slower, this will have to be tweaked though of course), this is to prevent the player from just having one on at all times, they'd
have to have at least half power before they can be active again
This should be DIFFICULT to code, so it may take a while and I may add other stuff while I'm working on this
I may add a gui overlay that shows how much power the current equipped amulet has, as well as an overlay for special weapon/armor abilities and
their cooldown

0.6.59
Added initialization of the gui but haven't actually made it yet
Changed armor event for hunter's armor set, will test it out now (Test failed)

0.6.60
Added a food test item to help someone out (they had a different problem then I thought so this was kind of a waste)
Meanwhile, figured out how to add biomes (register it the same way as items, blocks, etc. now)
Next thing to begin doing is to maybe add structures, but I also wanted to add more textures and actually begin working on the gui screen
for the amulets as this will be a good addition to the mod
Going to add the special for the Hunter's armor in the actual armor update method of it instead of using a forge event, this should work way
more effectively

0.6.63
Added Lightweight and Agility enchantments
Added more on to the Luck enchantment because of the new Xp orb pickup event
Will add a disable mobs configuration option in case people just want a certain thing from the mod specifically like potion effects or enchants
Changed Hunter's armor to gain enchantments on being crafted, it's special is now usable if you hold down the use special button, it'll give
strength 2, jump boost 2 and speed boost 4 (or was it 5?), there is a 40 second cooldown before it can be used again but the effects only last
for 20 seconds, the armor set also takes 3 damage every time you use it so that's another balancing factor (it may be unnecessary since the
armor is so weak though so I'll probably remove it)
Added ability for lightweight to reduce some fall damage you take

0.6.64
Reverted movement changes of lightweight, improved fall damage reduction, this was done because the increased motion was causing a bug with
hunger (it was used up extremely quickly)
I may wait for more deobfuscation of funcs and fields until I mess with this more as I need to create a player attribute modifier then remove
if when the potion runs out, I will do this from now on for anything that modifies player movement instead of doing it with motion, the only
exception of course is with flight and aqua superiority which pretty much require it
As such I'll wait for more deobfuscation before I add any of the other potion effect's functionality

0.6.66
Removed Lightweight completely, as I thought it was a pretty useless enchantment and the Hunter armor's special pretty much makes up for it
not being on there as an enchantment
Started to work on Veteran enchantment but found that it's difficult with most of the block's method's as funcs and fields, as such I'll have
to wait

0.6.67
After talking with someone on the forums, I've decided to instead of making amulets rechargeable, I'll make them actually break when their
charge gets to 0 (charge is item durability anyway), and make them somewhat difficult to craft, the expansions will also be rare loot from
generated chests
Armor specials are things I want to mostly just give helpful buffs or do other effects, things for fun or for extra ease to move around
The Draconic armor special will probably be the ability to fly, instead of making it a constant thing and have the player put no thought into
doing it
In regards to Amulets, I'm going to allow you to have more than one of each type active, they will each have up to level 3 that they can be
crafted in to, with each one requiring two of the previous version to make (two lvl 2's to make a lvl 3, two lvl 1's to make a lvl 2), so it'd
be difficult to craft them, much less obtain multiple to do so
I'll have to add nbt data to the player when they log in and out for their current amulet inventory and which amulets they currently have active,
I'll also have to maybe add a stat to keep track of these things so it'll affect damage and such
They could also be rechargeable by doing things like killing 100 mobs with them active, or killing a boss with them active, or obtaining a rare
item or something with them active, the recharge though would be scaled to the difficulty of the challenge though
Also maybe I could add the fact that armor enchantability affects resistance to magic intrinsically rather than having an enchantment do it,
this would also require the player be made more aware of enchantability through tooltips and such, but it would be a really good mechanic to
add as well (this would require rebalancing enchantability of some of the armors, but not that big of a deal since most come preenchanted any
way)
Another thing to think of, start thinking of achievements (to add on to the million other things to think of)
Also changed Hunter's armor special to require the player having an empty hand to use the special, so it doesn't interfere with the player
attempting to use a weapon's special 

0.6.69
Added ability to expand tooltips of certain items with spacebar to display more information about them, this is better than having it display
at all times (which is messy and annoying)
Made a note that I will probably convert most of the more unique enchantments into amulets as it would fit better (enchantments are more for
things that aren't too op, with barely any backlash)
I was originally planning to make this mod ssp only, but after chatting with that guy on forum and him telling me about his modpack for his
server, I will try to make it server compatible
Just figured out that the reason mob drops wasn't working was because I didn't register it with forge (derp), so now I should be able to add
item drops to vanilla mobs
Added skull drops to the skelton and creepers, they only drop these if they die from explosions, skeletons have to be exploded by a creeper
Will add one for zombies, maybe they have to be killed with a health potion to drop their skull
When I re-record the music from the previous version of the mod, and add more, I'll add these as a random drop from all of the mobs

0.6.70
Started adding framework for the Amulet items
First 3 to be done are Kitsune, Peace, Yeti amulets
Still need to create textures for a lot of things as well

0.6.71
Added textures for the amulets, these aren't displaying properly though so I need to change some code in the ItemAmulet class regarding the
item icons, I'll start working on the actual amulet abilities soon
Prioritized should be the gui screen for them, and getting the amulets to display properly in the slots, then creating something that allows
me to store nbt for each player's own amulet inventory 

0.6.74
Added more code for the amulets, fixed the textures as well
I'll have to create the gui screen first, along with the nbt data for the player to remember the amulet inventory, then I'll work on getting
the amulets to display in the gui screen properly, afterwards I will start working on the actual amulet effects
Added two new potions (not their functions yet), Resurrection and Harmony
Added a couple of food items, Exotic Fruit and Gooey Fruit
Removed a few of the weapons, some that were just elemental ones
I'm thinking of removing any elemental aspects the mod was going to have, but this may just be temporary until after release, or until a later
build when I have less that I need to do
I'm also going to begin working on the enchantability vs magic damage aspect, this will be a bit difficult to code, but only in terms of the
amount of code it'll take to do
Will remove the Ender Sword and ender jack and move their proposed specials into other weapons/tools
May remove tungsten as an armor set, but we'll see

0.6.76
Add more tooltips for the weapons and the skull armor
Fixed npe due to a reference to an unimplemented enchantment when using something with Multiply

0.7.84 [Began adding extended player properties that allow me to implement Doom and Magic]
Added extended player properties to store special cooldown and special amount as a global number for all items (individually for each player
though, of course)
Beginning to implement these into current items that use specials, starting with Hunter Armor
Added some documentation for the TragicMob superclass, for future reference and possibly for an api of some sort (probably not)
Removed Wraith entity for now while I test the cooldown properties
Fixed first bug with it (forgot to register the events, derp)
Added ability to gain special (as long as there is no cooldown and it is not maxed out already) when the player is hit or attacks a mob
Changed the way it checks for specials to be allowed to be used, now I can use variable special amount use and cooldown for each item special,
this allows for greater balancing with specials
Special amount will be known as Doom from now on, weapon specials will be called Doomsdays, all others will be called Influence
Will work on adding the gui overlay after a few tests to ensure Doom is working correctly
Fixed bug with cooldown being affected by recharge (wasn't checking for cooldown being 0 when incrementing Doom)
There's a bug with ticking the player to properly increment Doom and properly decrement cooldown

0.7.91
Started adding tooltips for armors/weapons to show magic resist and magic piercing ability
Doomsday specials will have different types, such as Crisis, that does more damage the lower health you have, Overflow, that does more damage the more
extra Doom you have after use, World-Ender, that destroys/alters nearby terrain while doing major damage to enemies in the area, and Ultimate that has
multiple stages of damage/destruction to surrounding terrain/enemies
Debug this problem with ticking the player, I have no idea what's causing it to increment by 3 or 5 randomly
Started a bit on creating the custom inventory for the amulets but there is a LOT of code involved so I'll debug the ticking player problem first
Fixed bug with ticking the player, apparently the ticks per second is 60 now instead of 20, which makes sense for some other issues with potion effect
time length on eaten food, this I think is only for ticking the player and everything else should use 20
Utilized a tick hopper to only decrement cooldown once per second, doom is incremented once per 24 seconds, currently there may be a bug with attacking
and being attacked incrementing doom properly, so this is being debugged now
Fixed bug with attacking/being attacked incrementing doom properly, it was due to a rounding problem with the float
Made it so if the player dies, they lose all of their saved up Doom
Gave functionality to Resurrection effect, when player revives it restores their health based on amplifier of the effect inversely to a factor of 4,
i.e. amplifier of 3 will restore 3/4 of their health, amplifier of 1 restores 1/4 of their health

0.7.96
Attempted to add functionality to Harmony effect, however, mobs seem to ignore being set to a null target or path, so I may need to find a workaround (I
could also set when something with Harmony attacks something, it's attacks are automatically canceled)
Added magic properties to all living entities, if magic damage/reduction is to be calculated, the normal attack event is canceled and damage is done through
the calculation
Not able to very thoroughly test this because I can't see health of mobs but I can probably let a witch attack me with potions to test
Witches are DIFFICULT to kill with this active, they automatically take 15% of magic damage done to them normally so magic pierce damage only does 15% that
it would normally do, this makes them like tanks against you, and they can heal themselves so it's crazy difficult to kill them, perfect
Did the same for the Wither, Ender Dragon and Endermen, though they will actually take more damage than the Witch due to it's special magic resistance, this
will make them way tougher to kill, they'll actually have armor now
Added tooltips for all of the vanilla armor/tool/weapon sets, this makes gold extremely useful for killing magical mobs because of it's high magic pierce
and magic resist, but it's low durability doesn't make it ideal for prolonged battles

0.7.98
Made the expand tooltips button (space bar) configurable, may as well so that people won't whine about it later, even though most people won't care or need
to change it
Changed when the magic properties are registered on an entity, instead of on entity constructing, done on entity join world, hopefully will reduce the
amount of npes the server comes up with
May add more weapons/armor sets so that I can work on adding more of the special types, and work on balancing them (they'll have no textures but it should
not matter much at all)
Get started on the gui overlay for Doom and Doom cooldown

0.7.102
Added Tungsten armor set (no textures)
Changed expand tooltips back to only being space bar, as the keybinding was not working (maybe it was getting called before the keybinding was ticked)
Added flare special to tungsten armor, only lights nearby enemies on fire, extinugishes the player, I also want it to shoot a fireball up into the air to
be an actual "flare"
Adjusted Doom gain from attacking/being attacked as it was too high, increased cap and reduced percentage of hit
Added new method to Doom to get the Overflow amount for when I add overflow doomsdays

0.7.106
Added new method to refill Doom amount for Doom upgrade's second ability
Added functionality for Doom Consume and Cooldown Defuse
Added plan for Amulet Release to allow recharging of amulets, amulets obtained or crafted will go straight into amulet inventory rather than the player's
normal inventory, should add a way to filter them by level, type and name
The recharge will only be partial, maybe 10% of the amulet's total charge, will still add the "challenges" such as live for 3 minecraft days without dying
or kill 150 enemies while it is active to give small recharges as well
Added Everlasting and Blinding Light, added Blinding Light's Doomsday (haven't tested it yet)
Everlasting Light's functionality can not be added until more deobfuscation is done
Still also need to test the Doom Consume and Cooldown Defuse
Added more language registrations
Fixed initial bug with Doom Consume and Cooldown Defuse not removing the item and doing the proper check for use
Added framework for achievements, still need to set their positions, descriptions, names and triggers
Also added the next amulet to work on, Reflection, should be easy to do, just take a lot of typing
Note: Doom Consume, Amulet Release and Cooldown Defuse will be uncraftable, only obtainable from chests and as a random rare drop from Guardians
Cooldown Defuse have a random rare chance to also drop from Mini-Bosses
Alphas/Bosses will always drop at least one of them
The corruption itself works, but damaging the player every set interval does not for some reason (it currently creates an endless loop, which confuses me)
Redundancy has been removed from the Corruption events code, but the damage still creates an endless loop that crashes the game

0.8.108 [Updated to new Obfuscated names, so now I can do more]
Updated all of the code to the new obfuscated names, now working with blocks and world should be way easier and I can get more of the specials to work now
Also, now I should be able to apply attribute modifiers to the player instead of altering their physics (flight and aqua superiority will still do that)
Work on block changing Doomsdays such as the Pitch Black's decay, Flare spreading fire around you and shooting a fireball into the air, Piercing Light 
putting Light orbs around the player randomly, and a few others that haven't been added yet
Piercing Light does not work currently, but I can use block brightness now instead of entity brightness (which isn't the right thing to use), so that
should allow me to fix it

0.8.109
Added two new potion effects, Malnourish and Cripple, malnourish stops the player from naturally regenerating (may not be possible to do), cripple lowers
the player's max health (through the use of an attribute modifier, this should be doable)
Attempted to add malnourish using the natural regen gamerule but it seems to have a bug where it won't let me heal the player at all while the player 
should be able to
The other problem is that it would make it incompatible with servers as it would only affect clientside with the natural regen in ssp, so I need to come
up with an alternative way to do this (same thing with the Flight effect possibly)

0.8.110
Made a workaround for Malnourish using the player's foodstats, this should work on servers as well, I still need to make it that you can't eat while your
health is too high to regen
The attribute modifier for health works somewhat, but I need to have it set to only apply the modifier once while it's active rather than every tick, I
may need to use a boolean and private int to do this the first time it's activated every time, to apply it once, then remove it as soon as the effect hits
0 duration
The attribute modifier is proving annoying to apply, so I may need to instanciate it inside the actual Potion class itself when it's applied, then remove
it when it's removed

0.9.116 [Added and gave functionality for all of the Potion Effects (except Fear), made possible with attribute modifiers and forge events]
Added potion effect functionality for Stun, Disorientation and Immunity, fixed effect for Cripple
Added balancing for Immunity by making it randomly add exhaustion to the player while active, made Cripple reduce jump height some while active
Stun now uses an attribute modifier to make move speed 0, but also disallows use of items and breaking blocks while active (you also can not jump)
Disorientation only does screen wobble with slight player move jitter 
Immunity disallows Poison, Wither and Corruption effects to be active while it is, but it randomly adds exhaustion to the player
Cripple reduces the player's max health while it is active, reduces player jump height by a little bit as well
Malnourish affects the player's food level, and only allows the player to naturally regen while your health is below a certain amount of health
Added effect for Harmony now, it doesn't allow anything inflicted with it to attack anything else, if instance of a mob, it lowers their follow range so
that they can't see the player, even if they are on inside of them
The only exception currenlty is that the spider will follow even when their follow range is 0, this isn't that big of a deal though, another exception is
that entities that teleport could still get to the player
I made Endermen, the Wither, the Ender Dragon and any bosses I make in the future, immune to Harmony
Made Endermen and the Ender Dragon immune to fire and explosives
Made Witches immune to wither and cactus damage
Made Endermen, Witches, the Wither and the Ender Dragon immune to poison as well

0.9.118
Need to figure out how to set up a packet handler in this version of forge (if we even need that anymore)
Adding new potion effect that increases all damage and knockback you would normally take, will name it Submission
Doom tiers will be named Consumption Levels now
Fixed Stun effect allowing affected entity to attack with a weapon
Fixed Cripple effect disallowing the player to jump up 1 block height
Changed Doom to LivingHurtEvent rather than LivingAttackEvent so that it only counts attacks that actually do damage/hit target
Moved Entity registrations out of main mod class to their own class, this doesn't change anything except where they are registered
Tested Endermen with fire damage and it still seems to take it, should maybe change it to LivingHurtEvent as well

0.9.124
Changed test with Enderman and Ender Dragon fire/explosion damage to the living hurt event, adding other damage types in regard to fire
Made that if either of them is in a block of fire, that it'll be set to air
Endermen still take fire damage from being in it, but they do extinguish the fire immediately if they are right on it
Fixed Blinding Light doomsday since I can now use the block brightness, it only works in darkness, made it use more darkness to scale the damage
Added Event priorities to the magic and doom events, should change some calculations when magic damage is done and special needs to be calculated, should
also adjust doom properly based on armor damage as well rather than raw damage
Fixed cooldown/doom bug with Blinding Light and Pitch Black
Made Doom Consume refill your special when it increases your Consumption Level
Fixed bug with Pitch Black not properly counting the right area for plantlife, adjusted weights for plantlife such that only an area of a huge amount of
leaves and vines and crops will give large amounts of health, otherwise the normal is 5, or 2.5 hearts, in healing
In preparation for an Alpha release soon, going to add more textures and try to get the gui overlay for Doom/cooldown done
Make the tungsten armor special able to put you into frenzy mode, make it the first Overflow doomsday
Inflicts Submission, Strength, Speed Boost, the effect level and amount of time will be dependent on the amount of overflow doom there is, with a cap of
lvl 10 and 3 minutes for each effect

0.9.132 (February 13, 2014)
Converted Blinding Light into a Crisis special, does extra damage the lower your health is, max total damage of 40 to enemies
Fixed submission, it wasn't properly applying the right damage percent increase because of a weird bug with the amplifier
Added negative effects when vanilla mobs attack you (a chance, different percentages for each effect)
Added attribute modifier for vanilla mobs to increase their max health as well (we'll see if this causes any problems, I'm expecting that I'll need to
remove the modifier then apply it every time)
Halved damage from arrows that Blaze take, but may end up making it magical anyway so this would be irrelevant, may make them only take a percentage of
total magic damage though like the Witch to make them difficult to kill
Added a vanilla fix that stops zombies from picking up eggs (it immediately gets deleted if they pick it up), this is to reduce them not despawning and
causing server lag, they could still pick up other things, but this is the only "natural" thing they pick up
Moved KeyBindings to ClientProxy to stop game crashes on servers
Doing a test build on the regular minecraft launcher, going to do a survival test until I get a diamond block (or until I get distracted/bored)

0.9.134
Improved vanilla mob buffs, fixed bug with them getting infinite health buffs, make them heal on world join so they have their full health, will also add
regen to some of them, like the enderman
Made Blaze a magical mob
Fixed game crash with Magma Cube, apparently it's not an entitymob, but an entityliving (weird)
Added health steal for slime, magma cube can also now set target on fire in addition to the potion effects
Fixed bug with Max Doom resetting on player death
Slightly fixed bug with Iron Golem damaging a magical creature, still has animation error with Iron Golem but not much I can do about that
Also made Blaze inflict disorientation on target if hit by them
Added Tungsten armor's Berserker doomsday, it is an overflow doomsday that gives strength and speed, but inflicts submission
Change Skull and Red Mercury armor to affect nearby mobs, with a small chance to affect the user (backlash)

0.9.138
Increased chance for debuffs from vanilla mobs, added creeper to mobs that get health boost
Increased Zombie and Creeper movement speed and knockback resistance
Added pig zombie spawn event whenever a pig is killed and difficulty is set to hard, 10% chance it'll do it, 50% chance for each pig nearby to be changed
Added same event for chickens, except it just kills them all lol
Added same for cows to convert them into Minotaurs, but since Minotaurs aren't implemented yet, it'll just light them on fire/kill them like the chickens
Research the packet handling system
May change magic events (magic pierce and resist calculation) to a tick update event, and recalculate once every 5 or 10 ticks instead of every tick
Don't know if this will allow ticking of entities though, so maybe I can just change it in the current class
This would probably produce less lag, the Doom events will still need to be handled every tick, to ensure of accuracy, but right now it checks 3 times
each tick so maybe that can be reduced to just once, though the doom amount and cooldown amounts should be in seconds, so maybe this could be reduced
to every half second (10 ticks, 30 ticks for players)

0.9.144
Altered magic events to do a null check and also only do magic pierce/resist calculation once every 5 ticks (4 times a second) instead of 20 
times a second
Altered Doom events to only tick the properties once every 60 player ticks (once a second), this should reduce the lag some since I changed it to a
byte, changed the Doom amount and doom max ints to shorts, cooldown was changed to a byte, these were updated in the nbt tags as well so may not 
display properly on initial reload for me
Fixed bug with Tungsten Armor Influence not doing the right check for amount of Doom the player has
The memory leak may have something to do with Java's memory handling rather than with forge/minecraft so I can't do much other than reduce it by
doing less things on each tick
Turns out it is a 1.7.2 minecraft issue, so I'll just have to deal with it until the 1.7.4 version of forge is released
Will use actual chat messages to display when a player uses a doomsday, going to make it say the type of the doomsday as well
And have it change messages based on effectiveness from type, i.e. Overflow doomsday with small overflow would say "You used an Overflow Doomsday
with vary little effectiveness.", but with a large overflow (max) it would say "You've used an Overflow Doomsday with Maximum Power!" and that
would probably trigger an achievement too
Should also change the magic pierce/resist ints to bytes as they should never be above (though other modders might put stupid numbers so I'll have
to do a check for that of course)
Adjusted Tungsten Armor's Doomsday cooldown due to changing the cooldown int to a byte

0.9.146
Started restructuring configuration to be easier to understand, better organization overall, will begin utilizing this and doing some checks to ensure of as
few npe's as possible
Added way more configuration options, with blanket configurations disabling the ones below it, but allowing them to be change individiually if it is enabled,
i.e. allowMobs = true, allowPlague = true, allowJabba = false, mobs are allowed, but jabba mob is disabled whereas allowMobs = false, sets all mobs to false
therefore, it'd be easier to check each specific thing that's toggleable by it's own boolean rather than using the blanket one, unless it's for initializing
the initializer, in which case it'd make more sense to check for the blanket configuration's value
Adding number configurations as well, for things such as spawn rates, corruption spread chance, ore generation, but these will have maximum caps set to them
with the minimum usually being 0, i.e. max spawn rate for Jabba mob could be 60, minimum would be 0, if user sets it to 100, it'll cap at 60, may also add
configuration for which biomes each mob spawns in, but that would probably be a lot of coding (would have to type out each biome, then put these into a list of
toggled biomes, then put that list into the mob's allowed spawn biomes (the list thing is easy, but typing out all the code without using a ton of configs may
be difficult, but I could just create a method that automatically gets the list)
This will all be done asap, to ensure of the least amount of game crashes, it will be tested a lot (probably, unless I get distracted/bored)
In the main mod file, I'll do checks for the blanket configuration options, then in each initialization, I'll check for each one under the blanket
Organized configs in an outline to allow me to do it easier/more efficiently, moved the config into it's own class to reduce code in main class
There is 189 configuration options currently (there will probably be more)

0.9.150
Restructuring all events and initializations for configuration
Restructuring initialization classes, may move all of these into an init package rather than have them each seperated into their own packages
Moved most of the initializations into the init package
Added code for Veteran Enchantment, testing now, afterwards will return to doing the configs
Test was successful after multiple npes from the config restructure and using the proper method to get the item enchantment
After getting it working, it will be removed as an enchantment and instead turned into an amulet ability, possibly the creeper's amulet, since it's so
powerful and destructive, the code for it may actually be used for a Doomsday as well, it would pick random blocks near the player (within a 3 x 3 x 3 block
area) and mine out huge areas, of course it would be a World Shaper special, it could also possibly give extra ores too if it breaks an ore
Will now test for npes with the configurations, starting with mobsOnly mode (which means the mod will be pretty much empty)

0.10.162 [Restructuring of all configuration to allow for better organization and understanding (and easier coding for me), also adding a bunch of content]
Fixed NPE with Gooey Fruit
Fixed NPEs with Vanilla mob potion effects (ones that used my potion effects)
Fixed NPE when a player dies (Resurrection effect check in Doom events)
Fixed NPEs when allowPotions is true but each effect is toggled false (mostly in Potion Events)
Fixed NPEs when allowPotions was true but each effect was toggled false again (mostly with vanilla mob effects)
Set up all of the configs for potions in the actual config file, along with mobs only and texture resolutions
Organized all Doom config booleans and ints
Set up Doom event and property configs, all others will need to be checked on each particular item that has a doomsday
Will need to check for allowDoomsdays and then to allow the particular doomsday type, then to check if cooldown is allowed, and also to scale each doomsday 
cost to the world difficulty setting
Set up Doom Consume and Cooldown Defuse's chest generation, set up all of the configs in both items classes
Set up most weapon configs, made the doom cost scalable based on difficulty
Added a placeholder "NoTexture" texture for items that I haven't made textures for yet, this is to avoid the weird checkerboard looking one, and to reduce
the amount of warnings/errors I get from not having textures
Added a couple more configurable options with Doom, about to do last configurations for the last few armors, then I'll start to create the doomsdays for
the Red Mercury Dagger and Skull/Mercury Armor

0.10.172
Afterwards I'll start to test for NPEs with the configuration options
Fixed problem where if a player had a Doom Consume or Cooldown Defuse, even if they were toggled off, they were still usable (though I don't think they did
their effects), even though they aren't obtainable if toggled off without cheats, this still needed to be fixed
Fixed an oversight where I forgot to add the config options to the Hunter's Armor
Fixed Doom Consume and Cooldown Defuse spawn rates for chests (they were spawning WAY too much)
Added framework for a new type of config, master configs, these are like presets for the mod, hardcore being the hardest presets, lightweight being the easiest,
maybe I could have users come up with their own presets, and I could add them if I think they are unique enough
I may also add presets for compatibility with other mods, for instance, I could toggle off enchantments/magic if you have mods in your modpack that do similar
things such as this, or if someone else's mod adds a lot of biomes that are similar to my own, along with berries/plants/etc., I could have a preset to disable
biomes, plantlife, etc.
Simplified main Tough Leather recipe
Fixed bug with Hunter's armor not working when allowDoomsdayCooldown was set to false (was doing check for cooldown amount instead of doom amount for doomsday
use, derp)
Added ability for Slimes and Magma Cubes to drain a little bit of your doom when they attack you, at least 2 per hit to counteract the amount you gain from
being hit, magma cubes do at least 4 per hit, max of 10, slimes have a min of 2, max of 5
Added all of the config options for Doom into the actual config now
Also added the master configs, lightweight and hardcore mode, to go along with mobsOnly mode
Currently neither of their presets are done completely, but they will be after all of the configs are actually tested and done
Achievements will be added after most of the content is added, including the mobs/bosses, but some will be added while the content is added, I could add
a few of them right now actually

0.10.194
Adding all of the current Enchantments (there probably won't be any more added after this, but they may still get tweaked)
Some of the armor enchantments that will be implemented on weapons will be split off into a different enchantment name, with the same effect (like how there
is fire aspect for swords and flame for bows)
I'll do what I did for the potion events and make allowEnchantments true, and toggle every enchantment false in the initializer to get every possible npe
Added Decay, Slay, Absolve enchantments in one class and gave function to them, there will need to be a check for whether corruption is allowed, if absolve
should even be active
Added Rune Break and Rune Walker enchantments, these are hardcoded into the Magic Events class, where their level directly affects the magic resist and pierce
calculations
Added Toxicity, Paralysis, Ignition, Death Touch and Elasticity enchantments
Tested out Elasticity, it works sometimes but not all of the time, it could maybe be better if I put it into the enchantment events and knock the entity away
like that
Changed Elasticity to get the nearest player to damage source and knock them away from the player, then multiply the velocity based on enchant level
Added Vamprism, Leech, Consume and Distract, Vampirism steals health and randomly inflicts exhaustion on user, but inflicts cripple on target, Leech steals
hunger and randomly drains doom from user, but inflicts hunger on target, Consume steals Doom from target and randomly damages the user, Distract inflicts
one of four negative effects to the target in different combinations, these are mostly view altering effects and are only meant to disorient the target
Need to test for NPEs with enchantments now (should mostly be contained in the enchantment events, but each item will need to check for the config too now)
Fixed NPEs in enchant events, the others are coded into the actual enchantment class so they shouldn't throw npes
Added the enchant configs to the actual config file

0.10.199
Skipping structures and biomes for now, since there isn't any implemented
Working on config for oreGens now, should be very easy
Added all configs to the actual config file, added more configurable ints to make up for the lack of configuration with the oreGen itself
Fixed possible NPE situation when using consume while Doom is toggled off, also fixed possible npes with slime and magma slime's doom drain when they hit you
Going to keep the Vanilla change configs as mostly blanket ones, only exception will be ones like the creeper's explode anyway attack
Started work on a custom packet for the doom gui overlay to receive the information from the server, going to attempt to fix the bug with it resetting on player
logout/login as well, then return to testing the configs
Added textures for Doom Consume, Exotic Fruit, Gooey Fruit, Amulet Release, Cooldown Defuse, 16 and 32x textures
Fixed bug with enchanting, forgot to set it to not allow multiple extra weapon enchants
Going to rewrite the way magic pierce/resist calculation works since it's buggy currently and now I have a better idea of how to implement it, after this I'll 
go back to doing configs (if I don't get distracted again)

0.10.208 (February 24, 2014)
Rewrite how magic pierce/resist is calculated and when it is done
Setting it to only calculate magic pierce/resist when certain mobs or the player attacks, otherwise, checks if it is a living entity and only takes the source
damage divided by the resist of the target, this should allow the iron golem to attack magical mobs without spazzing out (bugged attacking animation)
Reducing magic pierce of tools, hoes are divided by 4, all others are divided by 2, swords maintain full enchantability
Tooltips will need to be heavily updated with the configs and with changes to magic calculation
Completely rewrote magic resist/pierce calculation, moved most of the calculations into the magic property class, changed some methods and added new ones for
ease
Mob-specific resist/pierce amounts are hardcoded into it though
Rewrote the tooltips, they now check for instances of item superclasses for less typing, though I have to check against my own items to avoid displaying the info
twice
Fixed bug with Golems attacking magical entities, should reduce the damage they do to magical entities now
There was a bug with magic damage being calculated twice, due to the way magic damage is done (canceling the original attack and doing another with magic damage)
so I had to make sure the damage type was not magic, then calculate the magic resist/pierce, then do the damage

0.10.212
Attempting to fix bug with attacking magical entities, for some reason it's not doing any damage at all to some like the Wither and Enderman (I can assume
that it's doing the same for the Ender Dragon, the Witch only takes fall damage I believe)
For some reason, there's no on player disconnect event, unless I missed it, so I don't know if I'll be able to fix the bug with player respawn, it may have
something to do with packets, so I'll have to send the packet when the player disconnects and when the player reconnects to sync their doom amount and max
doom level and their current consumption level and other things that need to be synced
Adding exhaustion to the player once every few ticks randomly even when they're not moving, it won't be that common
Increased cap of submission along with the multiplier for the effect amplifier so that it increases damage with higher amplifiers at a steeper rate
Added a new event to cancel when the player has stun so that the player can't even begin breaking blocks
There is another bug with doom max being set to 0 on player respawn, this should be fixed now
These temporary bug fixes will be removed, and they will be handled exclusively through packets when I learn how to use them properly
Adjusted magic mechanics a bit, made the minimum magic damage, 1.0F, and have it get the ceiling float so if it is 1.2 it'll get rounded up to 2.0, etc., this
is to allow the highest amount of damage with magic resist/pierce taken into effect, and to allow non-magical entities to damage magical entities easier
Removed magical abilities from the Wither, it wasn't working properly with magic damage calculation, also removed from Ender Dragon for the same reason
Added textures for Pitch Black, Everlasting Light, Blinding Light, Crushed Ice, Sampler, 16 and 32x

0.10.226 (February 26, 2014)
Doing the last of the configs, for vanilla changes and magic
Added all of the magic and vanilla change configs to the actual config file, doing a short testing session now
Added mob and tooltip configs, added to actual config file, no testing done, but it shouldn't be that difficult anyway
Removed some small vanilla mob changes from magic events, and moved some to the vanilla changing events class
Adding more of the content now, will begin working on structures and other things
Added all of the elemental orbs, lightning orbs should be obtainable from thunderstorm clouds with the sampler as well as lightning mobs
Each orb's crafting recipe should require life water
Added light/dark particles, along with aqua orb, which is the only way to craft life water
Added textures for all of the orbs and the light/dark particles, 16 and 32x
Added small change to Resolution string to make way for higher resolution textures (which won't be done any time soon, so it doesn't even affect anything
currently anyway)
Will begin adding crafting recipes soon for the current items
Make a new item, Sap, that you can combine with Ectoplasm and an Exotic fruit to make a Gooey Fruit, sap will only be obtainable from sampling trees, different
trees will give different types of sap, oak will give you resistance, birch will give you absorption and jungle sap will give you strength, but good ones, dark
oak sap can give you immunity, spruce sap will give you health boost,  acacia sap will give you speed boost, the effects will only last around 15 seconds as sap
is easy to obtain, it can also be used as a food source, 4 of any type can be combined into aloe vera (with life water) and when eaten will give you immunity,
resistance and regeneration for around 5 minutes
Sap can also be combined with clay to form wax, which can be used for candles and for wax statues, you can obtain creature molds randomly and can create a statue
of the creature using the mold with wax (this would be a fun mechanic and would give users something to collect while playing, bosses would have molds too)
Another new item could be cloud essence, which could be used to craft the weather items and a few other things, like an item that grants flight to the player
Added boolean for a new master config, randomized mode, it will set all of the booleans and ints to a random value, this would be for random fun (even though
I generally don't like randomization, I thought it would be fun to allow users to try it out, the only problem I see is that it would be randomized every time
that they log in and that could cause problems)
Will try to keep track of dates on updates (not all of them), will add some dates in retrospect that I know

0.10.230
May begin working on some of the sampling mechanics, will export a test build soon to ensure that everything is working with magic, and rebalance as necessary,
will also test things such as Doomsdays
Adjusted vanilla changes with skeletons to ensure it'll only apply with skeletons that shoot arrows
Adjusted extra armor enchants to only take effect when it's a normal, non-explosive, non-magical and non-projectile hit
Gave wither skeleton the ability to inflict blindness on targets that are hit (since it already inflicts wither and gets a health buff)
Added ability for any mob that's on fire to light the player on fire (25% chance per hit)
Added ability for explosions to inflict nausea on the player if they are hit by it (50% chance)
The mob tiers will be, Mob (Vanilla mobs), Tragic Mobs (my deadlier mobs), Mini-Bosses (Corrupted Tragic Mobs), Guardians (Stronger mobs that usually have their
own structures), Alphas (Very powerful and difficult mobs that usually have their own dimensions)
Mini-Bosses can be transformed from Tragic Mobs but also will have a small chance to spawn in already transformed (this will apply, regardless of what corruption
is toggled to)
Created spawn egg for Tragic Mobs, and a seperate spawn egg for Mini-Bosses, Guardians and Alphas, hopefully it works correctly this time
These both have seperate entitylists, but each should work exactly the same, except for having a different texture
Creating one of the new mobs, the Jabba, to test out things with the spawn egg, I'll also work on it and give it all of it's abilities and properties

0.11.242 [Added first new mob, the Jabba, fixed bugs and gave it some unique abilities and such] (March 1, 2014)
Added the mob, Jabba, one of the weak mobs, it is meant to be a test mob, but it will get all of it's attacks/abilities after testing is done
Initial test of spawn eggs is not showing up properly, even though everything is (I think) registered properly, the mob should still show up though
Upon testing, the mob does not spawn, this is a problem
Removed custom spawn egg, I may have to create one from scratch
Created a clone of the spawn egg, currently it only gets the vanilla mobs, but I'm working on making it only do my mobs
Started fleshing out the Jabba mob some, it still needs an animation and maybe it's texture could be improved, but I'm thinking of giving it some fire abilities
too, such as being able to shoot fireballs when it's near fire, it would extinguish the fire and shoot a few fireballs per block of fire it extinguishes
Fixed probable bug with Damage Boost enchantments because of the movement of the creature registrations back into the main mod file
Added ability to light entities on fire when the Jabba gets hit, as well as it having a chance to steal the player's current item when it attacks you
Fixed bug with attribute modifiers stacking up on consecutive world reloads, set UUIDs for all of them as well as for the Jabba's attribute modifiers
Added some living animations to the Jabba, it looks a bit jittery right now (I have no idea why)
The jitteriness was due to a weird thing with how the vanilla minecraft ai works, I also increased the update frequency of it so that helped some
Added a fireball/explosive attack whenever it gets "angry" to the Jabba, it does it once every 20 seconds or so, faster if the player hits it, the only
issue is that the player could hit it and knock it out of it faster, but it'd be impossible to tell how much the player has to hit it and such without the
actual number (like I have)
May add another ability that it creates an explosion or shoots a large fireball if you try to attack it from behind, this would require getting the direction it
is currently looking and getting the position of the nearest player to attack it, this would also make it do it if the player is running away facing the same
direction as it as well (which works out fine)
The next mob I'll add will be the Jarra, a variant of the Jabba, however, it'll have very potent poison attacks rather than fire, it may have an ability that
just shoots spores everywhere and inflicts poison on everything near by (it'll spam particles in every direction and randomly inflict poison on all nearby entities
except for itself (it'll be immune to it anyway)), it'll be very potent (long-lasting poison II)

0.11.244
Added Jarra, gave it poison/stun effects rather than fire abilities, it is also the miniboss version of the Jabba, it's anger attack involves spreading massive
amounts of "spores" and inflicting poison/stun on nearby entities
I think most mobs will have some sort of "anger attack", but they will mostly be coded the same way as my previous version's mobs were
It also charges very quickly at enemies like a torpedo, it is quite deadly
Next mob to add will be the Plague, this will also probably have a major rewrite of the TragicMob/Boss superclasses and the Corruption Events class
I also need to maybe work on creating a wiki for the mod, because of the huge amount of things that are in the mod and the copious amounts of new mechanics there
are, in addition to the sheer difficulty of the mod, it would also be nice in that I wouldn't have to explain every little thing in an faq
Because of the addition of two of the new mobs, I'm going to post an alpha version for testing soon on curseforge, this will be after I create more of the item
textures and also add the model/texture for the Jarra, I'm also going to rewrite how Doomsdays are done

0.12.257 [Created a new Doomsday class, moved all current doomsdays into it] (March 2, 2014)
Rewriting Doomsdays into their own class so that I can call their effect by Id rather than having a copy of the whole doomsday, I will also move all of the checks
for doom amount and cooldown into this class as well, since the doomsday will be done through this class as well
Currently having problem getting the doom properties from the player through it, but it's probably not necessary, I'll rewrite some of the PropertyDoom methods
to fit what I've written for the doomsday class, then remove them from the doomsday class, that way it'll be way easier to get the player and also to do checks
for the player's doom and overflow/crisis, etc.
Added a few new methods to the doomsday class, added a bunch of utilities to expose more code and get what I need easier from it, everything should be fully
functional with it except for the actual doomsday effects
Changed backlashChance due to the new way it is calculated in the doomsday class
Fixed bug with getting the doomsday name and type from the string arrays, another bug is that they aren't getting the right element of the array for some reason,
so I'll adjust the doomsday ids and do a system output to see what the id of the actual doomsday is being displayed as
For some reason, it's putting the wrong id, even though there's nothing else changing the id except when the doomsday is initialized, but there is a fix that has
been implemented on the id and the type, so it should be fine for now
Added string localization to the doomsday name and type, may do the same for Doom and doom cost, along with a few other things
Will probably work on sampling after I get all of the currently implemented doomsdays to work with the new class

0.12.262
Adjusted the doomsday class to attempt to fix the current issue with it
Need to create a doomsday that does very high damage and maybe stuns nearby enemies but has a very low chance to not backlash (backlash would just inflict a
small effect like slowness II on the user for around 5 seconds)
All issues with the doomsday class has been fixed, I'm putting each doomsday into their own methods, this will allow me to randomly use each of them for the
doomsday I have planned that does that
It will also allow me to use each doomsday effect in commands, i.e. /doomsday Decay will use the Decay doomsday (with no backlash chance), there will also be
commands to set your doom amount, /doom 300 adds 300 /doom -50 subtracts 50, these are mostly for my own use but users can mess with them in creative if they
want to as well
I still have to test if the Doomsdays are using the correct amount of Doom and apply the correct amount of cooldown
May add a Crucial Moment chance to Doomsdays, where they have extra effectiveness rarely, maybe a 1 in 50 chance for all specials, this would also trigger
an achievement, some doomsdays may gain extra effects as well, this would be a nice counter to the relatively high chance for having backlash
In the future, I may split cooldown into each type, and allow the player to use multiple doomsdays of different types, with each one maintaining it's own cooldown
amount, so that you could use an influence one, then use an overflow one, then a crisis one, without the cooldown from the previous interfering with the latter
ones, this would probably be similar to how LoL has it's moves/abilities set up, except there's no doomsdays levels involved (though I could add that later on
as well, they could level up the more you use them perhaps, and have lower doom cost/cooldown and/or greater effectiveness, maybe just lower chance for backlash
and higher chance for crucial moments)

0.12.271
Added an achievement for using your first doomsday, doomsday achievements will be in their own branch
Added Crucial Moments as a balance to backlash's slightly higher chance of success, they have a much lower chance to activate but are always helpful
Added a few implemented but not actually implemented Doomsdays and added Crucial Moments to them
Added backlash to Nature Drain, completed Poison Break's Doomsday
Doing all of this removes durability damage from using a Doomsday, but backlash chance balances that
Added more dynamic scaling to Doomsdays regarding Peaceful difficulty, lower chance of backlash, higher chance of crucial moment, lower doom cost and cooldown
Removed some of the obsolete methods from the PropertyDoom class to clean it up a bit
Also, today I came across a mod named Jabba, which is a hilarious coincidence, I'm not gonna change the name of the mob that shares the name though since I've
had that name planned for a while

0.12.274
Working on adding packet handling so I can actually fix the bugs with Doom on reload, and then I can also start on doing the amulet inventory and gui and such
I would be done with this already if I wasn't so confused with how the packet handling works, I really need a good explanation of how it works, or a clear
tutorial on it
Added a lot of achievements, mostly having to do with Doomsdays
Tests with the achievements was successful, including using a Doomsday, so that's good

0.13.289 [Added Sampling Mechanic, only the block portion of it currently] (March 4, 2014)
Removed ability to use Doomsdays while Stunned or while Harmony was in effect on the player
Altered textures for the Sampler
Going to start adding block harvesting for the sampler with the Vanilla blocks
If sampler cannot be used to get a different drop from a block, it still mines the block but it does extra durability damage to the sampler (+3 from normal, which
equals 4 total)
Did initial testing with Sampler on some blocks, it works correctly, so I'll continue adding on to it and adjusting it
Sampler enchantments will be handled in the sampling events rather than the enchantment events because of the need for the exact enchantment levels to set up
proper results from them, I'll adjust block break speed as well
Adjusted break speeds, made them scale to wood log, so stone and anything with a high resistance (like obisidan) will take a long time to sample
Sampler takes around 12 seconds to break wood, super takes around 8, mega takes around 4, these times may get reduced depending on how difficult it is to
get samples from high resistance blocks
Added more things to sample, stone, netherrack, wood, and made new items from these, sap, rocks, lava rocks, thorns, etc.
The rocks will be used as throwable items, they can be crafted into cobblestone and netherrack (in case you somehow ever run out of either of these)
Thorns will be combined with vines and spores to create glowvine, which will glow but inflict stun and damage whatever goes through it, will make the gas clouds
an opaque block, all other mob drops should be entities (the gas clouds may even be changed into entities)
Fixed initial bug with mega sampler not checking properly if block was able to be sampled on sampling
Added a lot of items and their textures, their crafting recipes have not been set
Still need to add the model/texture for Jarra

0.13.294
Adding sampler enchantments, removed stability as it would be annoying to apply and it's not really needed anyway
May need to create a new enum for the enchantments to only be applicable to samplers
Added enchantments for sampler, need to test if they are actually able to be applied in an enchanting table, made it so you can only have either meticulous or
quirkiness, and biologist or geologist
Applied effects for Meticulous, Quirkiness and Geologist, Biologist will be applied whenever mob drop sampling is actually implemented
Added all of the enchantment ids to the actual config (they were never added, woops), added sampler enchants with their own blanket config and put them into the
config hopper (that's what I'm gonna reference it as now, since that's pretty much what it is)
Only problem with enchanting Sampler is that it can get unbreaking and efficiency somehow (even though it shouldn't be able to), unbreaking is fine as long as
it works, efficiency will mess with my set efficiency and geologist enchantment amount

0.13.304 (March 5, 2014)
Adjusted Jabba and Jarra's anger levels to get set to 0 if there is nothing near them when they are using their anger attacks (to avoid unnecessary looping on some
effects), made Jabba take half damage when it's health is below half, Jarra takes 1/4th damage when it's health gets below 1/4, and half when it's below half on
it's health
Added health buff/debuff for difficulty scaling to all of my mobs, also added "victory" buffs, when one of my mobs kills an enemy, they gain attack damage and
some health, it can only be applied once though, they also completely heal (may make victory buff only apply when they kill a player, but we'll see)
Added support for spawn egg colors finally, so now I can actually set them to the correct color values so they represent the mob they summon better
Made weapon class for Celestial Longbow, will add doomsdays for the Hunter's Bow and Celestial Longbow
Hunter's Bow will have a Crisis Doomsday
Celestial Longbow will have an Ultimate Doomsday
Going to have to learn how to use threads to make things wait a certain amount of time to execute, this is pretty much required for multistage Doomsdays, and
could be used for other things as well such as some amulet effects
Created the doomsday Rapid Fire, shoots multiple arrows (uses doom per arrow) quickly
I set Rapid Fire for the Hunter's Bow and Snipe for the Celestial Longbow
Fixed bug with Snipe (forgot to actually spawn the arrow that was to be fired, derp)
Made it so that the explode anyway thing for Creepers would only be on hard mode
Added Celestial Longbow with no texture as well, but this will probably be removed for the Alpha Release

0.13.306
Added new Doomsday, Pulse, for the Gravity Spike, it should throw all nearby enemies up into the air, then slam them down, and create an explosion and inflict
submission on them, should continue doing this as long as you have enough Doom, maxes at 10 pulses
This is having an issue where the entities aren't being throw into the air for some reason, maybe because of the thread use, but honestly there's no other
way to do this effect how I want it otherwise, so I'll test it out and mess with it more
By researching for a solution, I was able to fix the bug with the Hunter's Bow textures and 3d rendering
Fixed some typos and derps with the tooltips, adjusted the doomsday descriptions of some of them, started cleaning up the amulets but I'll continue that later

0.13.307
Using a packet handler and abstract packet from a tutorial now, going to try to use these to finally get the amulet gui/inventory going, as well as hopefully fix
the problem with maintaining the player's doom amount and consumption level
May rewrite the PropertyDoom class to simplify it and hopefully fix the issues with saving doom amount
This would be a major rewrite as a lot of other classes use it (enchantments, mobs, events, doomsdays, etc.)

0.14.328 [Rewrite of PropertyDoom and addition of new Packet Handler, along with gui for doom] (March 7, 2014)
Rewrote NBT Tags for doom, renamed variables, added current doom to data watcher for smoother updates of it
Added doom max to datawatcher as well, set up most getters and setters in doom property class
Fixed all errors with doom properties in other classes, slightly changed doomsday class and how it set doom cost and cooldown (used the faster method in the doom
properties class)
Added code to doom properties and doom events from CoolAlias's tutorial mod (he will be credited, as will Sirgingalot for his packet pipeline and packet code)
Added check for doomsday cooldown from configuration file, I'm not sure if this was ever put into it
Adding debug spam for testing now
Cooldown decrements once per second as before, doom increments once per 20 seconds on slowest rate, 4 per 5 seconds on fastest rate
This whole rewrite and packet addition fixes the bug with Doom not properly saving on player reload, now I'll work on the gui overlay for doom (finally)
Made inventory class for amulets, I'll have to set up the container and gui screen for that after
Added gui overlay from CoolAlias's code, changed a few things, added a cooldown overlay that shows over the doom amount whenever you're currently cooling down,
also added a blinking animation to the doom amount when your currently equipped weapon (or if you have an empty hand and full armor) has a doomsday that can be
activated
The gui overlay image will be changed soon, I just used his for initial testing and experimentation (I edited it a lot, but it's still the same basic image)
Exporting a build now and I'll do a survival test on my own, if I don't find/have any major bugs, I'll post this as the first Alpha version to CurseForge

0.14.334 (March 9, 2014)
Made Doom gui bars animated, added check if doomsday can be used to armor (player must have an empty hand and the full set of armor on)
Even though all these changes are being done to the gui, as said previously, it will be changed as the image came from a tutorial and I'd like to make my own
for it, I will also experiment if I can use a higher resolution gui display for it as well, as in the way images do (the texture resolution configuration will
affect the guis if this is changeable which I'm assuming it is)
Fixed bug with cooldown not resetting on death (forgot to add it in)
Adjusted pain recharge amounts and made it a flat 25% chance to recharge at all on each hit/attack
Adjusted again to only be a 25% chance on weak hits
Added extra stun effects where the player can't move the screen when they are stunned, as well as disabling render on the player's hand
Added command to increase/decrease your doom amount
Added command to use Doomsdays, but currently does nothing as I have to write a new method in the doomsday class to use without doing checks for doom/cooldown and
without applying cooldown/doom cost after use

0.15.344 [Added Amulet inventory, gui, and added nbt and packets to maintain/use it]
Adding container and custom slots to amulet inventory
Added gui for amulet inventory
Fixed problem where amulet gui wouldn't show up (forgot to register packets)
Set the gui slots up correctly with the gui (it's a placeholder), and made it so that the top 3 slots are the active amulet slots
Will make an actual gui for this and the doom amount later
Added functionality to Amulet Release
Currently there's a bug with actually adding the amulet slots with amulet release, so I may make it that they are always there, but they don't accept any items
until you unlock them (this would require adding some code to the inventoryamulet class to get the class and set if it is usable by the player
The gui works now, it's a bit buggy with accepting amulets into the unlocked slots but otherwise it works fine
I need to set when the player obtains an amulet, it gets placed into their amulet inventory
I'll have to create a custom block/container/tile entity that allows me to repair and upgrade amulets, I'll make it later on (I don't like making new blocks just
for something like this, but it is a large part of the amulets mechanic so I'll add it, it'll have multipurpose in combining amulets to level them up or in 
combining an amulet with an amulet release to refill the charge on it)

0.15.347
Added crying obsidian orb and regular obisidian orb, crying obsidian orb will be used for teleporting to your spawn point, normal one will be used for the 
awakening stone for amulets
Removed skull drops from Skeletons, Creepers and Zombies
Their amulets will be in random dungeons (would be fitting since those mobs do spawn in dungeons)
Cursed amulets will be able to be bought from a specific type of villager (probably cleric), for a large amount of emeralds (around 20 most likely), they will
also be able to be found in mineshaft chests and in stronghold chests
Moved entity registrations to their own class now that I have an instance in my main mod class
Adjusting amulet gui to allow the player to have access to their hotbar, so they can move amulets into it from there and out of it (instead of forcing them to
destroy amulets or throw them away when they inventory is full), this will probably be expanded to the player's entire inventory instead of just the hotbar
in the future, but for now I just want to get this working properly
Started working on actual amulet gui texture, it'll take a while to actually make it (it'll be pretty detailed and has multiple layers)

0.15.354 (March 11, 2014)
Added random extra mob armor and random mod enchants to armor, this applies only to skeletons and zombies currently and is applied on world load, they do not
save if you reload the world but that is a minor issue
Added the mob, Plague, it corrupts anything nearby
Testing corruption on the Jabba to see if it successfully changes into a Jarra, if it does, then I do not need to rewrite the Corruption events
Test was successful, had to alter the method for spawning in the miniboss to how the zombie spawns in a villager when it's converted as it would leave a fake
entity on change and not actually summon the miniboss, may increase the chance of transformation a bit
Increased chance of transformation a bit (from 1 in 16 to 1 in 10 every 120 ticks (6 seconds))
Added empty images for all of the armor renders to stop the annoying "resource could not be found" spam in the console

0.15.362
Altered Cooldown Defuse to be a static integer rather than a percentage, because of the way cooldown works, set default amount to 30
Added enchant effect to absolve that gives it a chance to remove corruption from a corrupted entity that is hit with it
Removed corrupt creature attribute as the only mob that would use it is the plague, made plague, jabba and jarra natural creature types
Added achievement for if you change anything in the config file, added achievement for killing a plague
Adjusted name for Reflection amulet to Claymation amulet
Fixed localization name for crying obsidian orb, light and dark particles
Made the plague mob always have corruption potion effect active
Adjusted corruption events a bit, removed the "infinite corruption" thing for mobs that get corrupted once since if they get corrupted it lasts for 8000 ticks
now anyway

0.15.367
Created AmuletHelper class to help with some of the math involed with multiple amulet effects of the same type being active
Adjusted ItemAmulet icons to display an overlay, the overlay is a placeholder until I decide what to do with it (I may even remove it completely)
Made amulets have a max stack size of 1, because they were never set to that (they should've been)
Added player's hotbar to the amulet gui, this will be expanded to full player inventory in the future most likely (maybe not, there shouldn't be a need to swap
between these that much because of the large amulet inventory space available)

0.15.372
Added framework for calculating same amulet types, and getting their efficiency, should account for having multiple of the same type on
Added amulet functionality for Peace amulet, should work for every combination of the 3 amulet slots involving the peace amulet, having more than one increases
the chance of inflicting harmony on mobs
Added amulet functionality for the Kitsune amulet, having more than one of them active at a time increases chance of burning/blinding attacker, but increases
damage from fireballs
Added "enchanted" effect to amulets that are lvl 3 or are cursed
There is a bug where if you have two of the same type of amulet on at the same time as a different one, the different one will be ignored, will need to add
checks in to still do the outlier amulet type while others are the same, this will only need to be done on the amulet checks where 2 of the types are the same
the others should still work correctly (i.e. when all 3 are different types or when all 3 are the same)

0.15.377
Added functionality for Yeti amulet, should not stack if you have multiple active at the same time
Adjusted explosion size per fall height
Fixed bug with having 2 of the same type of amulet on, at the same time as an outlier (had to add redundancy to the amulet code, there will be a lot of copying
and pasting involved in the amulet effects... sigh...)
Added some configuration options to amulets, still have to actually implement these into the code, then add to the actual config file

0.15.388 (March 12, 2014)
Added a new vanilla changing mechanic, on respawn you get inflicted with cripple, you also get inflicted with weakness, may also add submission but that would
probably be overkill (lol pun)
On death the player only loses half of their doom on normal, on hard the player loses all of their doom, on easy they lose 1/4 of it
Added a new potion effect, Inhibit, it doesn't allow the player to have regeneration, strength, speed boost or haste while active, and cancels out immunity
Increased chance of plague to inflict corruption on nearby entities
Added functionality to Crying Obsidian Orb and Bleeding Obsidian Orb, Crying one lets you set your spawn point in whatever dimension you're currently in and
Bleeding one lets you teleport to your spawn point in whatever dimension you're in, or to the overworld if no spawn point is set
Made the crafting recipes for them cheaper (before they took full lapis and redstone blocks, now they take single ones since they are single use now)
Added Gragul and it's miniboss form, Kragul, they are both undead type mobs
They both take only 1 damage per hit from anything, and do a flat amount per hit to whatever they are targetting (one tenth or one fifth of the target's max
health, they do suffocation damage so that armor doesn't matter and total health doesn't matter either, they will always take 10 or 5 hits to kill, just like
they will always take 5 or 10 hits to kill)
They are both hurt resistant for a short amount of time after hits, in which case they are invincible for a few seconds after being hurt

0.15.398
Removed the mob type from the Plague as it didn't make sense for it to take extra damage from Decay
Gave functionality to Claymation amulet, chance to reflect stacks with multiple amulets, but chance to gain a random positive effect on reflection does not, if
there are no enemies to reflect to, it does not remove negative effects, if there are, then it reflects it to all of them, only when it reflects will it have a
random chance to give a positive effect
That took a LOT of code, nearly tripled the lines of code in the amulet events by adding the Claymation amulet's effects
Added another orb, the Dying Obsidian Orb, that will take you back to your overworld spawn point no matter what dimension you're in, or to the world spawn in the
overworld if you do not have a set one
Dying obsidan orb requires emeralds to be crafted
Will be the last obsidian orb added
Fixed Inhibit effect, it should've been a negative effect but it was set as a positive one (was wondering why it wasn't being reflected)
Added functionality for Invulnerability potion effect
Still need to add functionality to Fear potion effect, I want it to path the player to a random spot that they can't control and path other entities to random
spots nearby as well, but I don't know if this is possible
Altered Claymation amulet to only allow reflection to mobs rather than any living entity

0.15.409
Created a structure, it'll maybe be the one for the Apis, probably will spawn in Savannahs, it will probably have a few variants (some walls are destroyed, some
walls are taller, maybe the middle structure isn't complete in some of them, etc.)
The structure will probably be completely coded by hand rather than using a schematic, it will take AGES to do it
Created framework for a summon block that will summon a boss whenever a player gets within 16 blocks of it, it will also set the boss's target to that player
Will work on it more whenever I actually have bosses to add
Added Minotaur, using the older version's model and texture (may brighten up the texture some), it is a Beast type mob, the first one, it is only affected by
explosions and projectiles
If the player hits it with something that isn't a bow, then it does damage to the item, if the player hits with an empty hand, then it damages the player
Fixed bug with Minotaur not doing it's charge attack
Added all of the currently implemented mobs spawn biomes, plague spawns in ALL biomes
Jabba/Jarra only spawns in the Nether, in deserts and mesas
Gragul/Kragul spawns in desert hills, extreme hills, mega taigas, roofed forests, swamps and mushroom islands
Minotaur spawns in plains, savanna, mesas, forests, extreme hills
Fixed mcmod.info file, had the wrong modid on it, derp
Added struck by lightning event for cows, that transforms them into minotaurs

0.16.414 [First boss implemented, Apis, with updated model/ai and an actual texture, shift to adding content over mechanics] (March 14, 2014)
Added Apis, updated it's model a bit, it can only  be hurt by projectiles, it is immune to all other damage
If it is in sunlight, it heals, it charges at it's target and creates explosions, may create a huge explosion if right next to target
It gains armor when it's health goes below half (it also renders a cool shield effect), it's armor increases again when it's below 1/4
Fixed most issues with the new ai, added it's charge attack and explosive leap, gave it a fireball attack at long ranges
Added an Apis Summon block and tested it out, added random message to the player when the boss is summoned (just for the lulz)
Adjusted ai for all of the mobs, fixed Minotaur's charge attack (used same fix the Apis used)
Added Wither and Ender Dragon summon blocks, this could maybe be used for a trap (like a pitfall that drops onto a flooded room with a wither summon block)
Fixed exception with Ender Dragon regarding the summon block (it is not an entity creature)
Finished texture for the Apis
Added dynamic health scaling for bosses, lowered Apis's health to 250 (was 500), goes up to 300 on hard
Lowered Apis's health to 200
Reordered the order of potion effect application in regards to Immunity and Inhibit so that if both are active, immunity's effect does not apply

0.16.422
Fixed bug with using Sampler (If you didn't have meticulous enchantment, it would cause an error with the random integer because of only one possible option)
Added 3 new amulets, Chicken, Martyr, Hornet
Gave functionality to Hornet amulet, hardcoded into the Magic Properties for now, doubles magic pierce, halves magic resist for the player
Hornet effect does not stack
Gave functionality to Chicken amulet, it's effects do not stack, but it will damage multiple if you have multiple on
Giving functionality to Martyr amulet, it's effects will not stack, but can stack with the Dragon amulet
Increased chance of Minotaur to do it's charge attack
Fixed Hornet amulet, it wasn't doubling the magic pierce in the right method for the player
Fixed Chicken amulet, it doesn't need to check for day or night time
Created new amulet textures, these are only low resolution currently
Made mid resolution textures for spawn eggs, removed my mobs from the vanilla spawn eggs, reorganized the order of the items

0.16.428
Added storage block of all the ores in this mod, Ruby, Sapphire, Tungsten and Red Mercury, also added one for Quicksilver just because
Added new texture for Tungsten and Red Mercury Ore, only low resolution right now
Added Wax block and the low resolution texture for it
Added recipes for all of the storage blocks and for wax, currently no use for the wax block, but I'll add candles and will hopefully be able to add statue molds
like I want to later on
Added partial functionality to the Everlasting Light, also added multiple icons to it that changes based on how much damage the item has
Added Ragr model, no render or entity class yet

0.16.443
Added entity and render class for Ragr, no texture/animation yet
Ragr has high armor and high health, it is immune to all potion effects except corruption, while corrupted it's armor doubles and it attacks anything around it
When Ragr falls, it creates a huge explosion, it also has high knockback when it attacks, it will randomly leap up into the air as well
It will spawn in warm climates like forests and extreme hills, but will mostly spawn in cooler climates like ice plains, cold taigas, etc.
Added Inkling model/render, working on it's entity class
It will be invisible in darkness and burn in light, it will be able to teleport between darkness and break torches that are nearby, if it stays alive for a long
time, it can spawn other inklings
It can break torches that are close to it, if it is in light, it'll attempt to path away to not burn, but it still goes back into it if the player is in it
It will attempt to summon extra help once every 15 seconds, 50% chance to attempt, and it will only summon if it's dark enough, it will also try to summon if it
gets hit by a living entity
Added texture for Inkling (easy texture), added teleporting to it, only between dark areas though
Made Ruby/Sapphire ores actually drop ruby and sapphire(they were dropping the block), this was due to deobfuscation
Increased height Ragr needs to fall from in order to create an explosion, reduced explosion size, even though it was hilarious to see
Fixed some attacking problems with the Gragul, Kragul, Jarra and adjusted the Plague's corruption to only affect mobs it can see
Made it so that the plague slowly dies after spawning in, reduced it's health to 6

0.16.450
Adjusted spawn rate of Plague and Inkling, swapped their spawn egg colors
Fixed mob infighting that was supposed to occur when some mobs were corrupted, the method I was using was never being called (like a few of the others I had to
remove), added it into the living update method so that now it should always be active, added the non-corrupted version to the ragr which will take precedence
over the corrupted one
Adjusted Ragr's ai to be able to attack other mobs/creatures
The Ragr is one of my favorite mobs now because of this, it's hilarious to see it fight, especially when it fights other Ragrs
Created new textures for the Light and Dark Particles and Crushed Ice
Made it so that when it's on fire, it's armor is way weaker
Added texture for Ragr, I'm being so lazy with it 
Trying to alter the set target event to work with the way harmony was originally supposed to, don't know if it'll work but I'll find out
Fixed Martyr's reserve use, it was only doing the minimum instead of the original amount

0.16.456 (March 20, 2014)
Added full functionality to the Everlasting Light
Added two light blocks, Light Orb and the Candle, they both give off lower light than a torch
Added two armor sets, the Light and Dark set, their Doomsday functionality has not been added yet
Added Gravity Spike weapon, Doomsday has not been added nor has it's effect or information
Started work on Pumpkinhead's new ai, it's attack damage will increase continuously until it's target is dead, or until it's dead
When it spawns, it sets a Pumpkin nearby as it's home, if it's home is destroyed, it doesn't increase attack damage when attacked or do it's kamikaze attack
when it's close to death
Pumpkinheads burn very quickly and die almost immediately when burned, they are passive and will only attack when attacked by somethign else, they burn in sun
When low on health, they can do a kamikaze explosive attack where they toss a lot of pumpkinbombs around themselves (pumpkinbombs explode into fireballs so
they will most likely burn themselves to death), this is only if their home pumpkin isn't destroyed

0.17.471 [Proper utilization of threads for Doomsdays, adding Throwable entities] (March 22, 2014)
Added Doomsday effects for Light Shove, Afraid of the Dark, added Pulse to Gravity Spike
Utilized Threads the correct way for Rapid Fire, have to extend it to Pulse and Nature Drain now
Added new method for increasing cooldown by a certain amount rather than setting it to a certain amount, this will mostly be utilized by multistage doomsdays
Sorted out most issues with Pulse, it should be pretty stable now
Working on Nature Drain at a later time, for now it'll be an instant effect
Slightly adjusted all mob's ai again, should fix issues with them doing weird pathfinding or freezing up
(I'm still learning how to use the new ai system)
Added potion effects to Light/Dark armor when you have the full sets on
Adjusted Jarra's "rage" attack to not affect player's in creative mode
Fixed bug with mobs not being corrupted properly
Added a few recipes using Gravel
Added a few of the amulet recipes, the Chicken and Hornet amulets are actually craftable in game
All of the amulets will be added to chest generation with a very rare chance to generate, if they are added in random chest gen will be another config, as well
as if they are craftable
Added rarity to Cooldown Defuse, Amulet Release and Doom Consume
Adjusted spawn rate of Pumpkinhead, set that when it's spawned with an egg, it'll search for a nearby pumpkin and if one does not exist, it'll create one
Added Gravity Spike and Light/Dark armor to the gui check for if Doomsday is currently available for use

0.17.478 (March 25, 2014)
Added throwable entities, rock and lava rock, also combined them into one item with metadata so there's that, lava rock does slightly more damage and sets what
it hits on fire, neither are able to be picked up after being thrown
Added Pumpkinbomb and Poison Barb, pumpkinbomb bounces around randomly on the ground and explodes into fireballs, the poison barb inflicts poison and has a tiny
chance to stun whatever it hits
Added poison barbs to Jarra's "anger" attack
Added a large pumpkinbomb that creates a bunch of small pumpkinbombs on impact, it creates a huge epic looking firestorm
Moved all projectiles to the special tab, made pumpkinbombs bounce around lower to the ground and more randomly, large pumpkinbomb creates an explosion on impact
now
Jarra's special move works now, it will randomly spawn in poison barbs as it's anger attack now
Converted the Doomsdays, Toxicity and Poison Break, to use Poison Barbs
Gave the Pumpkinhead it's kamikaze attack of spawning in a cluster of Pumpkinbombs near death, while it's home pumpkin is still there
Fixed bug when spawning it with the spawn egg, where it wouldn't create a pumpkin to set as it's home when there was none nearby
Made it so that if a Pumpkinhead is attacked, it calls all nearby Pumpkinheads to attack whatever hit it
Pumpkinbombs use one item with metadata now

0.17.488
Added EntityProjectile abstract class for fireball-like projectiles, will still use entitythrowable for non-fireball-like projectiles (snowball, ender pearl like
projectiles will use that), it was adapted from the vanilla fireball class
Added Neko Rocket, it'll home in on nearby entities or targetted ones (targetting doesn't work currently)
Restricting Ragr to only spawn above ground level (around y > 63) and only in cold biomes
Resolved some targetting issues with the Inkling, made it to only go invisible if it has an attack target, it will only render sprinting if it's invisible
Adjusted homing component of the neko rocket, it'll take a smoother path to the targetted entity
Added Neko Sticky Bomb (when it explodes it'll spawn cobwebs around detonation point) and Neko Cluster Bomb (along with the mini bombs it spawns) which creates
a huge chain of explosions
Added Tragic Neko with full texture, new model and basic ai
Added it's projectile attacks and death move
Added some failsafes and filters to make the Inkling do it's attempt to summon help way less, does a check for how many are near it to determine if it's possible
to summon more, if there aren't enough near it, it'll attempt the summon, else, it'll ignore the summon attempt
There was a ton of lag, I think it was mostly caused by the Inkling, but I'll have to do some more testing to see, reduced the amount of checks the Ragr does for
destroying the terrain, since that is a very laggy operation to do a check for almost every tick, it checks once every 20 ticks now, and has a 1 in 8 chance to
actually do the checks
Refined Tragic Neko's death attack

0.17.498
Working on structures to add, going to attempt to start making them with world generation
Created around 5 random structures to add, a couple of these are traps
Modifying how long corruption is put on you from the Plague so that if you get corrupted early game, you don't always die
Made it do a check once every 3 seconds, instead of every tick randomly
Added Tragic Weapon superclass, added TragicArmor superclass as well
Altered checks in Tooltips and Gui to simplify them with the new superclasses
Scrapped work on making the Summon Block a multiblock, instead they'll each be different blocks with different textures
Added world generation for structures, working on adding framework for structure variants (each different structure will technically be a variant with it's own
id) and then I'll work on the schematics for each one (will take FOREVER and EVER and ever and ever and ever...)
Finished most of the framework for generating structures based on structure id, added some extra methods for variants and boss structures
This will allow me to add structure generator blocks for creative mode easier, they will be called Structure Seeds, to grow structures
Fixed some server-side issues with rendering the stun effect (it was attempting to do it server-side as well)
Fixed a bug with the Plague (syntax error)
Removed freezing the player's screen as it wasn't working very effectively and was buggy, maybe in the future I'll attempt it again but for now the effects
are adequate

0.18.508 [Adding Structures and their Generation, first Boss structure and other smaller random structures]
Added DataWatchers to config, for the user to be able to resolve some cross-mod-compatibility issues
Created schematic for the min y value of the Apis structure
Added chest gen for boss structures, took a really long time to do (almost as long as the one layer I did in the Apis structure schematic)
Added world generation for structures, made them quite rare
Lowered overall structure rarity, added seprate structure rarities for each structure (variants are fully randomized)
Added structure configs to actual config file, just need to add the schematics for all of them (ugh...)
I'm really hating my decision to do the schematics manually, but at least it gives me more control over the randomization of block placement
Made a small mistake missing two rows of the structure but it actually looks better that way (plus it makes it smaller so that's a plus)
Screwed up some with 2nd layer of the structure, but I was able to fix it
Added 3rd layer, registered tile entities because I forgot
Finished Apis structure, removed variation from it because it doesn't really need it (it already has built in block variation, but otherwise doesn't need it)
Made it so Ruby/Sapphire ore now gives the proper amount when mined with fortune, and also gives xp when mined
Reimplemented biome selection for Apis structure

0.18.517 (March 31, 2014)
Adjusting ore reduction filter, hopefully it'll reduce the ore rates of vanilla ores properly
Reduced values of the ore generation, hopefully that will reduce the lag from world generation
Adding structures to config, adding ability to toggle each structure in the config
Added potato and carrot blocks, for the lulz and cuz I felt like it :3
Attempting to use metadata with the structure seed but it's not going well... so I'll scrap it and do it later, for now I'll combine the itemblocks of the
structure seeds and summon blocks to one itemblock each, and I'll change them later on when I figure out how to do metadata blocks
Revised description of scythe, put it into the proper creative tab, added potato and carrot blocks to the blocks that it is effective against
Added a way to create potato and carrot blocks without the recipes, this would mean the recipes would be removed and the blocks would drop a random amount of
carrots/potatoes, they will still be crafable with 9 carrots/potatoes but they will not be able to be turned back into those 9 carrots/potatoes
Working on schematic for desert tower with it's variations now, hopefully this will be done by today so I can release a new test version for april fools
The tower has a built in tnt trap, but there will be a random chance that it'll have water or lava in place of the tnt
After making the schematic, I decided to add a trapped chest to the top, I've also made a sandstone pressure plate
Made a Nether Brick pressure plate, added structure seeds for each structure variant
The nether tower will have a chance for lava inside of it instead of tnt (or lava tnt, that'd be cool)
Added mesa and forest variant of the tower structure, the mesa variant is slightly slimmer and shorter, the forest variant is pretty much the same as the desert
version
The Nether variant will be the same as the desert one with slight variation from the mesa one and lava traps instead of tnt traps

0.19.524 [New block types, experimental blocks, etc.]
Working on a new block for traps, the Disappearing block, that when sent a redstone pulse, it disappears, but when no pulse is sent it re-appears (players can fall
through it when there is a signal sent to it)
A few issues with it is, I can't get the texture of a block near it for some reason and when it is invisible the blocks around it aren't rendered completely
Decided I'll just add some block types as variants of the vanishing block, so that they'll have those block's textures but still behave like a vanishing block,
I also fixed the problem with rendering other blocks around it when it's invisible, removing the invisible block from the creative tab inventory
Set that the disappearing block can be pushed by pistons as well, it'll be a wip block until I can get it to properly camoflouge itself, but it is functional
otherwise and works exactly how I want it to, moved it to the special tab
Added Quicksand block, adding mud and nether drudge, these would be better as liquids but for now will stay as normal blocks
Quicksand will only spawn in desert biomes (world gen will replace sand), mud will spawn in jungle and swamp biomes, nether drudge will (of course) spawn in the
nether
Sandstone and Nether Brick pressure plates are now craftable (like the other pressure plate's crafting recipes), quicksand, mud and nether drudge will not be
craftable, you will need to find them in the world to collect them
Added world gen for the quicksand, adjusted rarity and vein size a bit, going to make ruby/sapphire generate only in the nether (below y = 50), removed a few
config options for ruby/sapphire ore generation (the range at which they generate)
Made it so ruby ore generates below y = 50 and above y = 20, and sapphire ore generates above y = 85 and below y = 115
Added Nether variant of the desert tower, it has pretty much the same tnt trap except it adds in lava as an extra hazard (may add in the nether drudge as the
floor for extra annoyance, but probably not)

0.19.530 (April 3, 2014)
Added a few new weapons along with their doomsdays, Harmony Bell, Mourning Star and Beastly Claws, and their Doomsdays, Harmonizer, Ravage and Beastly Impulses
Added their textures for mid and low resolution
Fixed an issue with doomsdays in Tragic Weapon superclass, as well as added a variable for material to allow for new weapon effects
Added another weapon, Guilty Thorn, with it's doomsday, Torment
Added "combo" attack with Beastly Claws, made Mourning Star able to do double damage against magical enemies, made Harmony Bell able to deflect half of damage
when you are attacked with it in your hand, and made it so that you can't hurt enemies with it, but you inflict harmony on them when you "hit" them
Added multiple extra effects, changed Harmony Bell from taking half damage when you're attacked to healing you once every 6 seconds while it's in your hand
Altered Ravage to always activate and create random explosions, regardless of if entities are in range
The Mourning Star is ideal for killing magical enemies now
Added Mercury and Tungsten armor icons (Tungsten will be changed to be "smoother" looking, Red Mercury will be changed to look more "rough, uneven")

0.19.542
Made it so that bosses do not despawn naturally (mini-bosses still can)
Added recipes for mud and quicksand since they should be pretty common
Changed mud world generation to allow it to generate on grass as well as dirt (should be more common of a sight now)
Added a lot of blocks/items to the ore dictionary (now that I actually remembered it existed)
Fixed the issue with the Plague not dying after a certain amount of time naturally
Fixed exploit where if you dropped the Beastly claws in the middle of a combo, you would keep your attack modifier
Fixed bug with explosive projectiles where they would leave "ghost" blocks when they explode that the player could get trapped in
Altered Neko Rocket to shoot normally when you first fire it, then home in on a target that it flies near, also altered it's physics a bit, made it always 
explode on impact, and set that if it has a target and can't get to it within a certain amount of time, it explodes
Improved physics of most of the projectiles, made it so sticky bombs actually stick to you (they detonate quickly so they don't stick to you for long)
Fixed render of the Neko Mini-bomb, it was rendering as a Neko Cluster Bomb
Fixed localization error with Doomsday name and type (using proper method for localizing now)
The Sampling mechanic that was implemented may not be done, it may be released as a standalone mod with it's own item sets and block types that are seperate from my mod (but
still usable through the ore dictionary)
Created textures for the Enigma Shield and Thardus

0.20.548 [Removed Sampling Mechanic due to lack of focus (overall focus for the mod) and too much workload for me]
The sampling mechanic will be scrapped, some items that were planned to be used with it will be removed as well
Removed sampler enchantments and removed sampler configs from the config file
Because of this, mob drops will be implemented now to all current mobs/bosses and to some vanilla mobs
The sampling mechanic may be added in a standalone mod that has a lot of compatibility with this mod (and maybe a few others), but not anytime soon (of course
if someone else wants to do it for me, it'd be nice)
Added what should be the last of the food items (may add a few "op" rare ones later on)
Added textures for all of the food items, low and mid
Some items that were going to be scrapped from the sampler being removed are going to actually be kept, I'll add these items into the normal block break event and have a
random chance that they drop instead of the block (like flint from gravel)
Added a container item for the food items that use them (Rice, Ice Cream, Bone Marrow)
Added crafting recipes for Nasty Fruit, uses Bone Marrow and an Exotic Fruit
Altered Gooey Fruit's recipe to use Sap instead of Ectoplasm
Added crafting recipes for Rice, Bone Marrow, uses the same recipe as Ice Cream
Added crafting recipe for Ectoplasm, magma cream combined with life water
Altered biomes that the Apis Temple can generate in, it can only generate in Savannas now

0.20.561 (April 7, 2014)
Altered Minotaur to take a quarter damage from everything but explosions and projectiles now instead of being immune to them (if you run into it early game, you will die
almost immediately due to their high attack damage, so at least now you can try to knock them away), altered Apis in the same way, was thinking about making it that it is
non-magical until it's health goes below half then it becomes magical but I'll save that for another boss (Death will probably use it)
Added crafting recipe for Life Water, it uses ghast tears and a glass bottle
Added item drops to vanilla mobs, the Witch and Zombie Pigman get the most new drops
Added the common drops to my "normal" mobs, next will be the mini-bosses and bosses
Added a new item for crafting purposes, Horn, no texture yet
Added a new weapon, Neko Launcher, which drops from the Tragic Neko, it also has a Doomsday (it originally wasn't but I thought why not), it shoots neko rockets (duh)
The Doomsday allows you to shoot a quick stream of rockets and does not use durability (normal rocket firing does)
Added drops for the mini-bosses and for Apis, the drops are done in a way that something should drop nearly every time they are killed (if recently hit by a player) and will
have a good chance to drop "rare" items
Added a few optimizations to the Inkling's pathfinding for when it's set on fire and when it's in a bright area
Added Glue, a new item meant for repairing tools/items, it only repairs 50 durability and uses at least 3 xp for each repair, it is only meant to repair low durability
weapons/armor/items and costs a lot of xp to repair high amounts, should mostly be used for repairing a weapon/armor that has barely been used
Made it so that glue repairs up to 150 durability with a max xp cost of 5, but it cannot be used on enchanted items
Added a superglue variant that has high cost but fully repairs most armor/weapons (it would also be expensive to craft), it can repair enchanted items but costs extra to do
so
Neither Glue nor Superglue can be used for naming items
Added crafting recipes for Glue and Super Glue, Super Glue recipe is subject to change (since it doesn't fully make sense but I may leave it anyway)
Added the drops for vanilla blocks

0.20.575 (April 9, 2014)
Added textures for Glue, Super Glue, Neko Launcher, Horn, mid and low res
There is a game crashed cause when I use Doomsdays that spawn in multiple entities (multi-stage ones that use threads), this is due to multiple being added while the client
is going through the list of the entities that need to be rendered by them [not sure how to fix]
Adding new projectiles, Solar Bomb for the Apis, Spirit Cast for the Kragul (Death Reaper may use it also)
Going to experiment a bit with using models for the projectiles as well
Added Solar Bomb for the Apis to use
Removed some unnecessary code from main class (should very slightly increase load speeds)
Changed all of the current mob's basic ai (should fix some issues with them)
Altered Divine Justice to only occur if there's less than 5 of the slain animal nearby, this is to reduce the chance of it occuring if the player has a farm set up, if it
would activate with 10 pigs nearby, it would spawn in around 40 pigmen (probably being hit multiple times in one tick by lightning)
Added a check in structure generation if structures are enabled in the world settings (set in the main menu when you first create a world)
Added Spirit Cast, currently utilizes same render as the other projectiles, I want it to actually become a cast of the entity that uses it, but I don't have the proper
programming knowledge to do so yet
Added Light/Dark ingots to create the light/dark sets and their weapons (they may be used for other things as well)
Added crafting recipes for Light/Dark items
Changed Amulet level-specific effect names for localization (they can be translated to other languages now)
Slightly changed textures for Red Mercury and Tungsten non-rendered armor
Added rendered textures for Red Merury and Tungsten (low res)
Added Spirit Cast to the Kragul, fixed an issue with it's ai, it now shoots spirit cast at it's target when it's far away
Will eventually alter Spirit Cast to render as the Kragul's model with an opaque texture (scrapping original idea of having it use whatever entity that shoots it's model
Slightly altered the way bone meal was used to create potato and carrot blocks (using code from my mini-mod that just adds the potato block), it now uses bone meal every
attempt to create a potato block instead of only when it works

0.21.590 [Adding more mobs, their unique ai and adding more bosses] (April 11, 2014)
Created new models for Tox (Magmox) and Death Reaper
Adding them now, may also add the Hellhound back, this whole update (.21 update) may become an aesthetics update (along with all the mobs I'm adding)
Added newly implemented mobs to config (not to the actual file yet)
Added model for Cryse and may create a new model for the MegaCryse (add more pointy things maybe)
Added base texture for all of the new mobs, not the actual texture just the placeholder one generated by Techne
Added Tox, it'll shoot spores at it's target, when corrupted it'll target other mobs/entities, it'll only be able to take damage when it is shooting spores
and it takes extra damage if attacked with a scythe, it takes way less damage if attacked when it hasn't fired or isn't firing
Magmox will be immune to fire and will shoot fireballs instead of spore, it can be transformed from tox, but will also spawn naturally in the nether
Slightly improved chance of creating a giant potato/carrot with bonemeal
Fixed bug with Magmox spamming fireballs
Added Cryse mob, it is a magical mob, it can also transform into a Mega Cryse, it takes extra damage from fire and from being hit by a pickaxe, it inflicts slowness and
mining fatigue on whatever it hits, it moves slowly but deflects 1/4th of damage it takes on to it's attacker
Added Mega Cryse, fixed issues with it's shield ability, just need to change it's model and such
Added Death Reaper, implemented a Demeanor ai (which may be used on other mobs), if it is hit by projectile/long range attacks it'll become aggressive, if hit with multiple
close range hits, it'll become defensive and move away from the target (and shoot more projectiles), if it hasn't been hit in a while, it'll reset to aggressive

0.21.598 (April 14, 2014)
Added the new batch of mobs to the config, adding Banana and Banana split food items, adding banana as a throwable projectile (may make a banana peel entity that the player
can slip on, but that'll be done later for the lulz)
Created and added the models for the Pirah and Nor-Vox, re-using the ones for the Kitsune and Bangatang (I'll create a new model for the tameable fox-pet, which will be
probably named the Kitsu)
Created entity classes, nothing added to them, for the new batch of mobs
Created entity ai for Kitsune, attempting to fix some flaws with it's previous iteration by making it teleport less, making it spam small fireballs after it's been hit and
I'm attempting to make it teleport around the player randomly as well
Kitsune ai should be mostly done, it now teleports to the player if they are far away from it
Created ai for the Nor-Vox, it shoots wither skulls randomly (has a random chance to be a blue one), if it is hit while shooting, it'll be stunned for a couple seconds and
stop shooting wither skulls, it only spawns below ground, unless in a jungle (or a variant), in which it'll spawn above ground as well
Started work on ai for the Pirah, it's going to take a lot of tweaking to get it right I assume
There's an issue with the Pirah's air, but I'll just supercede it with my own air variable and damage it accordingly to hopefully fix that issue
Another issue is that it doesn't move up to the player if they are above it, but this could be an easy fix
Added an entity selector to allow Pirah to target any living mob that isn't another Pirah
Fixed issue with controlling the Pirah's air supply, also fixed issues with it moving when not in water, added a few random motion factors to make it move around more when
in water, though it'll still be mostly motionless until it has a target to attack

0.21.615 (April 17, 2014)
Made it so that Pirah do not take fall damage
Made some slight adjustments to overall ai (fix some targetting issues with older ai, to implement the new ai's targetting instead)
Removed magical aspect of Death Reaper, going to instead reimplement it's cloning ability
Fixing some issues with the cloning ability
Added a new Potion Effect, Clarity, that disallows the player from having any vision-altering effects active, trying to also make it that the player can see invisible 
entities while it is active (client-side only)
Couldn't make clarity work with invisibility like I wanted, but I'll get it to eventually (shelved for now)
Altered some small things with Doomsdays, fixed issues with applying cooldown on them after use (they used the wrong amounts)
Fixed some issues with the Death Reaper Clone not staying alive long enough, optimized the Death Reaper creating the clones
Added texture for Ragr, Pirah, Kitsune, Death Reaper (and Clone) and Cryse (also Mega Cryse), adjusted their spawn egg colors to match
Added semi-transparency to Cryse and Mega Cryse, Mega Cryse will get it's own model and updated texture later on
Added two of the blocks for the Death Reaper's structure, will add this next release since this release has been so delayed already
Added textures for Banana, Banana Split, Reaper Skull and Kitsune Tail
Added Kitsune and Death Reaper summon blocks
Added functionality for all of the current amulet's configs and added them to the actual config

0.21.618 (April 20, 2014)
Added the last batches of mobs to the actual config (derp)
Working on a Killswitch block, most likely suitable for farming (It'll use a Lightning orb and redstone in it's recipe), when it is activated it'll hit nearby mobs with
lightning at a certain interval, since it only targets mobs and it attacks them with a lightning strike, it wouldn't be that suitable for farming animals
There will be a basic one and a super one, the super one will do more damage and have twice the range
Created Pulsar block, works like the Killswitch one except it pushes entities away from it (mobs) without doing damage
Reduced range of both block types and reduced killing power of the killswitch
Further reduced killing power of killswitch but increased it's frequency, made it so that the pulsar/magnetar can pull in items towards it, making them great to use together
for automatic farms. Though it would seem more useful to combine these into one block, I'm not going to, in fact, I may seperate the effects into other blocks

0.21.628
Added textures for Killswitch and Pulsar blocks (and their super versions)
Adding new block variants for the dark rocks, Cracked/Faded Dark Stone, Explosive Dark Cobble
Adding other blocks just for aesthetics/building blocks, Obsidian variants (Crying, Dying, Bleeding), Light Cobble, Wicked Vine, Glow Vine
Added textures for all of the blocks, will work on the two vines later
Created schematic for Death Reaper's structure (Death Circle), set it so that exploding cobble and dark cobble stay lit on fire for an indefinite period of time (similar to
netherrack)
Death Reaper's structure will randomly generate in the Nether now, until I actually add the dimension
Added Structure Seed for it, added Death Circle to actual config
Added check for structures to make sure that there is enough room for the structure to generate (not really needed for overworld structures, but nether structures need it)

0.21.633 (April 25, 2014)
Added Reaper Scythe and Enigma Shield, still working on Enigma Shield's recipe, and working on their doomsdays
Do preparation for converting structures to vanilla structures
I'm probably gonna rewrite the Doomsday class using what I've learned from making the structure schematic classes
Working on the doomsdays for the Reaper Scythe and Enigma Shield, still need to test the Enigma Shield out
Added an extra property to the Enigma Shield, it'll completely nullify magic damage if blocking with it
Modified some aspects of shields, most of their main functionality is handled in weapon events
Since I can't get the shields to work properly to reduce damage, I'm instead going to make it act like a normal item that can block a certain type of damage
Added the Doomsdays for the Reaper Scythe and Enigma Shield
Current/Planned Shield-like items are:
Enigma Shield, blocks normally unblockable damage sources (fall, void, hunger, etc.) except for magic damage
Everlasting Light, blocks projectiles (any projectile)
Celestial Aegis, blocks explosive damage (any explosive damage)
Tragic Sentinel, blocks all unblockable damage including magic (pretty much any damage done to the player will be converted to magic damage unless it is toggled off)
Still working on adding additional weapon attacks/properties to the weapons that already have Doomsdays

0.21.637 (April 28, 2014)
Added last craftable weapon, the Withering Axe, along with it's doomsday
Added permission levels to Doom/Doomsday command, optimized their code a bit, Doomsday command does a check if the id input is higher than 32 but haven't added function to it yet
Added the next group of amulets:
Blacksmith amulet, will pick random damaged items in your inventory (that are repairable and not in your hand currently)
Apis amulet, will make you completely immune to explosions but will increase your damage taken from projectiles
Creeper amulet, will give you haste (level dependent on amulet level) and with max level will allow you to mine multiple blocks when you mine one
Zombie amulet, will nullify some hunger damage (not all of it) and max level will stop your hunger from dropping below 1 drumstick
Skeleton amulet, will give your arrow shots a random enchantment (higher chance for higher level), max level will give your shots all of the possible bow enchantments (randomly)
Sunken amulet, will give you aqua superiority while you're in water, but will make you take more damage as well
Will give them functionality soon

0.21.649 (April 30, 2014)
Added String Array of Doomsday names for ease of coding for returning their names (I don't have to look for the method to add each of their names, it's mostly automatic now)
I've decided I will not rewrite the structure code to fit Vanilla code as it would take way too much code-rewriting and I would much rather use that time for things that actually
need it
Added some checks for valid space to spawn the structure, and to also add a few checks to make sure it doesn't spawn on or inside another structure (unless they are made out of
valid blocks then there's nothing else I can do about it)
Increased chance for attempts to generate structures, with all of my tests, the results seem to be quite valid
Adjusted overall spawn rates to allow for more structure attempts
Added another tower structure variant (ice), it's a weak variant but yeah, whatever
Fixed bug with Nor-Vox attacking other mobs (it's not supposed to)
Added Structure Seed for the Ice Tower
Added most of the amulet recipes (some are subject to change like the Martyr amulet)
Gave functionality to Blacksmith amulet, it does not stack, repairs items up to 7/8 of being fully repaired, also repairs completely if an item has 1-3 points of damage
Gave functionality to Apis amulet, it doesn't stack (except with other amulets like the Kitsune amulet)
Gave functionality to Creeper amulet, I've decided not to add the "vein-mine" aspect, instead it'll just give haste (since gunpowder is easy to get anyway to craft it)
I can always give the vein-mine aspect to an epic amulet in the future (Combustion amulet perhaps)
Gave functionality to Sunken amulet, also altered Kitsune amulet slightly (now only lights enemy on fire if it is a non-projectile hit)
Just need Skeleton and Zombie amulet functionality now

0.21.660
Added more item/entity/block names to the lang file
Added the new batch of amulets to the actual config
Altered registrations of blocks to the "new" method that I recently discovered, combining itemblock registration into the normal game registry to avoid the unnecessary buildup
of itemblock declarations in my block class, thus allowing for more clarity when one of them is called from another class
Altered some of the Block's names, altered block names for lang registry for just my specific blocks (so they don't cause compatibility issues with other mods)
Added a couple item textures, Reaper Scythe and Withering Axe, added/changed various block textures
Added more of the block names to the lang file
Adjusted Doom command to reset cooldown regardless of output (assuming the command is properly inputted)
Made ToolMaterials private in TragicItems class to make finding items easier, removed master configs (except mobs only mode) from actual config file until a later date when
I can actually implement these
Made it so the obsidian variants can't be pushed by pistons
Set default texture resolution to 16, this matches with vanilla the best
Experimenting with Metadata on blocks again, to attempt to save id room and to allow me to set up blocks better (less declarations in my blocks class and easier to get what type
it is without having to go through each possibility manually)

0.22.676 [Converting most blocks into metadata blocks, this will change most block ids and some world generation] 
Converting all (most) of my blocks into metadata blocks, this will break some structures that use my blocks (only a few of them)
Converted all Ore Storage blocks into one id, this will complicate the luxury block randomizer in my tower structure but I'll create a workaround soon
Converted Summon Blocks into one id, this is a huge thing and will make it so much easier to organize them
Converted Structure Seeds into one id now as well
Converted Obsidian and Quicksand variants into their own block ids
Fixed any issues brought up in Doomsday class, World generation class, and in structure schematics, altered recipes
Fixed a stupid derp bug with metadata blocks, I had the creative tab list add the proper itemstacks, but it added them with a stacksize of 0 which meant when used it would remove
the itemblock from my inventory without placing the block
Made Structure Seeds use color for each different one, I'll probably keep it that way
I have to actually make a texture for each of the summon blocks, but it's simple to do anyway
Converted all of the dark blocks and light blocks into their own ids (should be 3 different ones, dark brick will be left alone for now)
Adjusted Death Reaper's structure schematic for the new metadata block use
Fixed some minor bugs with structure seeds
Moving all survival-obtainable items into the main creative tab, keeping creative mode only and survival-unobtainable items in the special creative tab

0.22.682
Added amulet damage to all amulets that just give potion effects (Kitsune, Creeper, Sunken), since the effect is pretty much continuous it has a random chance at a set interval
to be damaged
Added amulet damage to blacksmith amulet every time it repairs something
Added new boss parameter to my spawn eggs, so now I should be able to use a different texture for boss eggs
Moved Iron Golem before the bosses in my entity list, to keep the bosses together
Pets will be after the normal mobs and before the bosses in the entity list, vanilla bosses will be before my bosses
Added some of the proper critera to toggling blanket configs in the config file (fixed some missing config options when the blanket config was toggled for it)
Added a new config option to toggle explosive potion effects, also adjusted it to not affect players in creative mode

0.23.692 [Addition of pets, more mobs and more bosses, huge content update to balance out the huge backend code update]
Added Bangatang, gave it a hybrid ai between a wolf and ocelot (normal pet ai), it'll attempt to jump on enemies it gets near and it'll slow them down
It will run away from you, unless you tempt it with a banana, currently doing tests to ensure it is possible to tame them
Changed spawn type to creature instead of mob
Added Snow Golem natural spawn to ice plains and ice mountains biomes (this will generate more mob-infighting and will also create more mob variety in these biomes)
Testing/Messing around with the Bangatang ai, I'll turn it into a superclass for all of my pets (Tragic Pets superclass), then I'll work on the other 2 I plan to add in this
update
Got the Bangatang ai to work the way I want it to, their breeding item is Exotic Fruit now, if they are riding something and get hurt then they have a chance to dismount from
the entity they are riding
Changed previous ability for the Zombie amulet, it now has a high chance to nullify hunger damage
Changed previous ability for the Skeleton amulet, it will now have a chance to ensure your bow shoots with a fully "charged" shot no matter how low your actual charge is
Slightly fixed Tooltips, these may be deprecated in favor of a wiki, may possibly add an in-game wiki type thing (gui with pages of information, it'll take a LOT of work to do,
regardless of what option I go with for putting all of the mod information)
Added recipes for Killswitch, Tormentor, Pulsar and Magnetar (slightly expensive)

0.23.706
Adjusted tooltips again (shortened most of them)
Optimizing normal mob and boss ai now, I'll work on each one individually to make sure they are doing what they are supposed to do (proper pathfinding and such)
Creating a helper method for my mob's loot drops, I'm going to have a Hashmap containing each entity class along with an ItemStack array [first time using a hashmap],
then all I'll need to do is call the method from the onDeath method in the superclass rather than individually like I've done
Removed debug option from config, added new mob loot configurable integers (so that people can make any of the drops more common or less common)
Added an extra recipe to make jack o lanterns use my candle item/block
Added the normal mob and mini-boss drops to the new entity drop helper class
Altered some of the mob's normal and rare drops, they should all now drop more items (especially if killed with looting) so that it's worth killing them
Added drop for Pirah (it never had one apparently)
Adjusted drop rates of common and rare drops, made common drops not drop every time the mob is killed, made rare drops very rare (near vanilla rarity)
Added an extra potion effect, when a mob/creature has blindness/disorientation/confusion it'll take slightly more damage and will have reduced follow range
Converted current Bosses to the new drops system
Created TragicPet superclass, modified a few aspects of Bangatang's code to remove new redundancies that were presented due to this change
Added Sly, it has partial-Kitsune ai, it teleports to it's target and attacks it inflicting negative effects on it and then teleporting away
It also will kill animals if not tamed, it is tamed with potatoes, it spawns in mesa biomes (and variants), it does not breed
Sly is currently bugged and will not teleport to entities, nor will it attack
The pets also will not follow their owner properly, may revert the superclass change due to this

0.23.722 (May 13, 2014)
Reverted the change of pets to my own superclass, instead these will each have their own classes that extend entitytameable, doing testing now
Added new icons for Pet spawn eggs (it may be changed in the future but I wanted a different icon for them)
Added Golden Sushi food item, meant to parallel the Notch apple in terms of food (and gives more reason to craft sushi other than for novelty)
Adjusted Apis's explosive attack to reduce damage of it (since it is pretty much an insta-kill, I want it to do less so that it's survivable but still pretty lethal)
Optimizing structure world generation again, removing some redundant or unnecessary code, as well as ensuring that the world generation is only done server-side
The structure gen for all of my structures will now only be done once per chunk, and it will do a bunch of pre-gen checks to see if the spot chosen is valid for generation
as well as ensure that structure gen is allowed in the game rules
After that is all passed, it then checks the dimension and iterates through possible structures for that dimension until one of them is able to be generated, checks are then
done with that specific structure to ensure it is the proper biome for it, then if there is proper air space for that structure to generate
Added chest to Death Circle, added chest content to the chests in the tower and death circle structures
Added cursed amulets to chests in the boss structures
Debugging issues with the pets right now
Fixed issue with the pets (it affected all entities due to me screwing up something in the living update events)
Adjusting mob ai, hopefully fixed issue with Inkling causing entity tracking errors as well
Still messing with Sly's ai to get it work how I want, fixed Bangatang's ai for the most part
Added Dark Sand and Dirt, will maybe test out a biome soon to see how all of these blocks fit together
Adjusted tooltips again
Fixed issue with Death Circle chest not generating properly (it needed a space above the chest)
Added Doom and Doomsday usage to the lang file
Slightly adjusted Sly's ai, marked Bangatang and Sly as WIP for a new release

0.23.722reUp [Should've been 723, but too late now]
Fixed server-side issues with block icons (should now allow it to load on servers)
Fixed new client-side issues with the array length
Fixed localization issues with light cobble blocks
Hopefully this will be the last reUp I'll have to do

0.24.734[Rewrite of Doomsday class, functionality given to Doomsday command]
Converted mob egg types to an enum, this makes things a lot simpler when categorizing them
Added an enum for Doomsday types, this is a small change but goes along with the rewrite I'm planning on doing
Converting all Doomsdays to use one method that is overriden in the main class (each doomsday will get it's own class now), they will all also override a method that will
allow for use through a command (without needing doom requirement and cooldown checks)
This will take a while to do as I have to create a new class for each doomsday (over 20) and then I have to make sure I override the proper methods as well as accomodate
the multi-stage or time-sensitive ones (like Rapid Fire and Reaper's Laugh)
Initial tests with the command works perfectly so I'll just have to create the rest of the Doomsday classes and it'll be complete
Continuing rewrite of Doomsday class for the Doomsday command functionality, currently I'm trying to allow the user to use either the string name or the integer id to use
a doomsday, I'm also going to have to add backlash for each Doomsday as well since I decided to do a test and reduce cooldown amounts of all of the doomsdays
There is currently only a special exception in regards to the rewrite for the Pulse Doomsday as it has a two-part process for it's ability
The game crash caused by spawning in entities while they are being updated has still not been fixed
Converted Harmonizer into a Crisis Doomsday (because there's way too many influence ones, some of these will be reworked into other types)
Added all planned Doomsdays (including the ultimates), but they do not have functionality yet
Converted a few other Doomsdays, made the main doomsday class abstract, going to test it out now
There seems to be a bug with threaded doomsdays currently, I'm looking into it

0.24.753 (May 18, 2014)
Fixed issue with threaded doomsdays used through command, it wasn't supposed to check for Doom/cooldown when used through the command
Lowered all of my mob's movement speeds, altered most of their ai to allow for watching nearby living entities rather than just players, lowered follow speed of most mobs
and also adjusted a few small things
Made it so that Ragr target tameable mobs over players
Made Bangatang immune to fall damage
Fixed bug with Sunken Amulet, adjusted their "names" to only display the name
Debugging issues with amulet inventory, apparently it doesn't properly save nbt of it and the slots don't hold to the state of the player's current open amulet slots correctly
Fixed issues with amulet inventory, now properly saves nbt data of inventory and the active slots now react properly to the player's currently unlocked amulets, also fixed
a possible cheat with shift-clicking an amulet to place it in a locked active slot (you now have to actually drag amulets into the active slots to set them, which is not
that much of a hassle and switching amulets shouldn't be done too often anyway)
Added safeguard into the amulet event checks of amulet level/type to ensure that the slot they are checking is actually active, otherwise it returns null and is ignored
Moved Tormentor, Pulsar, etc. to Survival tab
Renamed main and special tabs to Survival and Creative tab, respectively
Optimized Ragr's crush block ai, it'll now do the checks using loops (less memory usage) and it'll now use a set to compare against, as well as causing changes in specific
other blocks (i.e. crushing stone into cobblestone, cracking stonebrick, crushing cobblestone into gravel), also made it only apply when it lands rather than while it moves
as this makes more sense, it is also completely disabled if mobGriefing is off
Reduced cooldown of all doomsdays, the rare weapon doomsdays will have high cooldown/cost
This will be applied to some other things that utilize similar methods
Added two new DamageSource types, modMagic for the magic mechanics I have in place so that it doesn't affect potion damage, suffocation for the gragul/kragul so that it
isn't void damage that they use to kill things
Replaced previous damage methods with these, also added the methods into the main class for easier access, this allows for the damage to have an entity attached to them so
that it's not just classified as a random death from magic
Changed player respawn to be easier on players (lower weakness effect and none on easy), as well as moving it into respawn events with doom (out of key input events)

0.24.768 (May 20, 2014)
Doing some mob balancing and ai fixes now
Reduced amount of fireballs Jabba shoots when it is in anger mode, also reduced damage of explosion it creates
Reduced health of Minotaur from 60 to 48
Increased duration that Nor-Vox is stunned for when hit while shooting wither skulls, slightly reduced health from 60 to 50
Made it so that Inkling now becomes visible for a few seconds after being hurt (if not already visible), this also prevents it from spawning help in that time
Removed the summon help aspect from the Inkling as it seems to be bugged currently, also made it so that it appears for a brief time if it attacks something
Looking into issues with the magical mechanic of the mod, I'll need to export it to the normal launcher so that I can use damage indicators mod to see the actual damage
Increased Pumpkinhead's movement speed a little bit
Reduced Ragr's health from 100 to 65, increased it's jump height when it's "angered"
Reduced Tragic Neko's health from 125 to 80
Reduced hurt resistant time of Gragul and Kragul
Reduced magic resistance of a few of the mobs, again, will need to export the mod to see the actual damage inflicted on and by them
Reduced health of Apis to 200 from 180, reduced health of Death Reaper to 250 from 220
Changed Kitsune's fireball spam to use hurt resistant time (which was reduced in length) so that it works more reliably and at a more predictable rate
Also fixed Kitsune's fireball spam location (it was firing from above it's head)
Reduced following range/distance of most of the mobs, including the bosses
May have finally fixed the Doomsday threads, I set the lowest priority for both of them so that the regular minecraft client and server would take priority over it in regard
to rendering and such, it hasn't crashed yet but there will be a lot more tests
It wasn't effective to completely wipe out the crashes but it still reduces the amount of crashes, also added an additional check that lowers the chance again

0.24.778 (May 25, 2014)
Added base schematic for the obsidian cavern, it'll have a long straight tunnel going straight down to the cavern (it'll have a ladder going all the way down)
Plan currently is to add a couple more of the bosses and save the new mobs until the Dimenion is done (which will take a while)
Attempting some basic rewrites of the Doomsday thread in order to make it work 100% effectively with the main game's thread
Converted Pulse to use the regular Doomsday thread instead of it's own
Changed thread priority of the Doomsday thread to be max priority so that maybe it'll run before the main mc thread
Anything I try to fix the ConcurrentModificationException isn't working entirely, so I'll leave it for now and come back to it later
Did a bit of planning for the biomes that the dimension will use, it'll feature a large amount of my own biomes as well as a few vanilla ones, I'll also try to create new
vegetation and natural-looking structures/features for them as well (this will be a huge project to undertake), I'm also still trying to decide on a world height (will probably
use 128 or 256, with the water level set at ~32 if it's even used), will have bedrock at the bottom of the world but not in every spot (the bedrock will have natural holes in it to add
some excitement and caution for mining if you decide to do so)
I want it to use an amplified type of terrain generation but there may need to be configuration options to toggle this
Added textures for Tox and Magmox, updated their spawn eggs
Made base classes for the Yeti, Time Controller and Polaris, I just need to code their ai and create basic render files for them to test them out, I'll also work on the pet's ai
Added the basic structure generation and schematic id setup for the obsidian cavern structures, I'm still trying to decide if I want the structure to actually generate as variants or
if I want it to have a random opening with a random cavern every time, the structure seeds would have set variant types though
Removed console spam from the Inkling, started work on the schematic for the obsidian caverns, it generates properly now I just have to get it to generate random chests/command blocks
as well as create schematics for the cave openings, then I have to add some way to get a specific combination out of each one for the structure seeds (which will only have 4 set ones
and 1 randomized option)
Setting up the new Doomsday for the Tungsten Jack, Miner Skills, it picks a random set of blocks near you and mines them, then mines from those spots until it spreads more, this may
be really laggy so I may have to change it to a more random selection method
Did some pre-planning for the obsidian caverns again, this will be finished soon, the main thing I need to do is create the cave openings and create the directions for them (there will
be two directions of each one, possibly 4 variants)
Openings: Ender Dragon, Apis, Death Reaper, Wither

0.24.788 (May 30, 2014)
Finished up Miner Skills Doomsday, maybe will come up with a better name before release, it works quite effectively, also set the efficiency for the Jack, it'll be craftable as soon
as it's implemented into the release (it just needs textures and it's good)
Added Tungsten Jack and it's doomsday to localization
Added some extra insurance with the Potion core changes that ensure that if it fails to set the potions up properly, it'll ignore any potion events, it should also set the allowPotions
boolean to false
Addressed an instance where an enchantment could result in a rng attempting to be generated from a negative value, this should be uncommon but changed anyway to address it
I was trying to decide if it occurs if I could check the value of potionTypes[] to ensure that it is set to at least 64 so that I can do it even if it's already been done
Started doing some basic work on Polaris's ai (very basic)
Started some basic work on a World Helper, to get things like random blocks in a set range, or random entities in a set range with less work
Did some reorganization of packages, to reduce the overall amount of them (this is to keep things better organized and easier to find)

0.24.800 (June 6, 2014)
Things have been moving along slowly for this release, but I'll get to a point where I'll do a ton of work on the mod, for now it's not my main priority
Added drops for the 3 new bosses
A new idea (gotten from somebody on eclipse's forum) is variable mob drops, if you kill a mob in a certain way it drop different things (like when animals drop cooked food when they
are on fire when dying)
Removed Killswitch and Tormentor as there are other mods that do their jobs better, instead I'll have a few weather related ones to give more use to my items and I'll convert the
Magnetar to push things away and the Pulsar to pull things towards it (including items)
Also changed them to have a cubic area of effect rather than a rectangular area that encompasses the entire y axis
Going to work on Polaris's ai now, made it so that when it gets hit, it'll randomly go into spam mode, it'll also teleport away when it gets hurt (when not spamming) and will also
randomly teleport when not spamming, it'll appear invisible while not spamming until it's near it's target and it moves quickly, it also clears any weather that may be occuring to keep
things clear, it heals itself during the day and has higher armor
Started work on Polaris's model, it'll be a thin cyclops humanoid, red, black and yellow will be it's main texture colors, it'll have a shield generate when it's spamming (like the
one the Apis has when it's health is below half)
It's ai is mostly done, just need it's texture for the next release
Only issue so far is that it won't teleport at all for some reason, maybe I'll have to adjust the code for that some
The focus is on finishing the three bosses I'm adding, then maybe I'll do some more rebalancing and optimizing, then I'll start trying to figure out how to add the new dimension
Registered Tile Entity for the Magnetar, forgot to so that avoids some future issues that might've occurred
Changed Pulsar to target animals and mobs, does 0 damage to them but pushes them away (this could be used for mob traps or animal farms)
Removed player parameter/variable from the Pulsar and Magnetar as I decided it was useless

0.25.824 [Non-Doomsday weapon abilities and new Polaris AI] (June 8, 2014)
Altered recipe for bone marrow to use bone meal instead of bones
Greatly reduced chance of divine intervention when killing animals (it was meant to be a rare occurrence but it happens way too often for that)
Altered some aspects of Polaris's ai, still need to test it out
Removed fire aspects from Polaris as I confused it with a sun god, it will be a star god instead and get power from night time, this means it won't be immune to fire anymore but it
will still teleport and be invisible otherwise (if on fire you can still see it when invisible)
It shoots spirit casts now instead of fireballs during it's spam, and it doesn't set it's target on fire anymore
It drops star pieces (reference to paper mario) intead of sun shards now as well, the star pieces will be used for... something, no idea what yet, probably just a component to the
weather items and for the time manipulator to summon the Time Controller
Adjusted Dynamic health qualifiers, more mobs of my mobs should be affected by it and bosses should all be affected by it
Reduced Inkling's damage to 1.0 from 2.0, this really doesn't affect it much but it's main strength is it's invisibility in darkness and silence which it can use to get a lot of hits in
I'm going to delay working on the Pets, they aren't a priority right now, as such they will not be in future releases for a while
Adding non-Doomsday abilities for some of the weapons now, these abilities will use Doom but will use the previous version's cooldown system, that way only actual Doomsdays cause 
cooldown and Doom has more uses other than for the Doomsdays
Converted the Blinding Light's projectile block ability and the Enigma shield's unblockable damage negation to use Doom instead of just inflicting durability damage, this gives more
use to Doom as well as making you have to maintain it to actually use the abilities and save up enough for Doomsdays
Added fireballs and large fireballs to the Reaper Scythe, these use their own cooldown system and don't affect overall doom cooldown however you still need Doom to use them
Added Wither Skulls and Blue Wither Skulls to the Withering Axe, these use the previously mentioned system that the Reaper Scythe uses
Converted Neko Launcher to use Doom per rocket fired as well as durability (it is a really devastating weapon anyway)
Made it so that the Gravity Spike will now launch enemies away from you when you hurt them (huge knockback)
Added Solar Bomb to the Blinding Light when right clicked
Added a single explosion ability to the Mourning Star, shifting and right clicking will create an explosion at where you are looking, right-clicking without shifting will create an 
explosion on you
Slightly improved Nature Drain's healing effectiveness (gave grass/farmland a bit more weight), also fixed a couple of small bugs with it's code
Added crafting recipes for some of the weapons (I forgot to add these like the derp that I am)
Converted Awakening Stone's recipe to be shapeless so that it's easier to craft
Created new items to add more use to the Time Controller's drops, you can now create the Celestial Aegis and Celestial Longbow from it's drop (combining with other items), it will
also gain other uses but for now this is the main one
Added some more item trees with it to have the Shifting Sands used for all of the weather items and the time-manipulator item, which also uses time essence, it could also have a
Doomsday that makes all animals nearby grow up, all plants nearby grow, etc. 

0.26.846 [Addition of two new bosses(Yeti and Time Controller)]
Updated to Forge 1112, should be barely any changes [It apparently now spams the console with the packets every time one gets sent but they still work]
Messed a bit with the code to register dimensions, this will be a huge task to set up, especially since I want to use my own custom biomes in overworld-type world generation
Made it so that dirt can only drop glowstone when below y = 32, also reduced the chance of a few similar drops to occur
Moved recipes into the preInit after all the other preInit methods but before the proxy preInit
Slightly reduced chance of mob to change into a Mini-Boss (very slightly)
May create a normal mob version of the Ragr and update it to a Mini-Boss since it is pretty strong, this would also reduce some lag
Improved how Threaded Doomsdays work (inverted the qualifier for them to apply at anytime that's not a normal server tick)
Set Creeper always explode to default to false, removed villager trades from the config
Added Yeti's model, render and texture (reusing previous version's)
Removed the pet's render registries for now
Working on the Yeti's ai now, it now works as a hybrid of the previous version's Silver Impala and Apis ai, with it's own little uniqueness added in
Preparing to add the Time Controller, I'll also have to add the Abomination soon
Polaris and time Controller will be Natural-type bosses
Yeti is a Beast-type boss
Created a new enum just for the Time Controller's time modes, it'll make things easier than a boolean or int since I could just use switches on everything like I did in the Doomsday
class
About to work on the ai for it, actually I'll save it for tomorrow
For the Time Controller's ai per time phase:
Future mode - It has higher armor, is immune to projectiles and explosions but takes extra damage from magic, it also attacks with armor-penetrating magic and moves faster, it may
also teleport randomly
Present Mode - It has normal rmor, moves at a normal speed and takes normal damage from everything
Past Mode - It moves slowly and takes no damage until it shifts out of past mode, it does half damage in this mode but has a chance to deflect damage back to the player, it will also
attack with projectiles randomly in this mode (which it tosses at random in random directions)
It uses the Time Bomb projectile, that when it exlodes turns into a Time Disruption which damages players that get near it and sucks other entities towards it
Implemented the proper weather changing abilities to the Polaris so that it can keep the sky clear when it is alive
Made it so that a few of the bosses that spawn in help will have their help target the boss's current target

0.26.861 (June 12, 2014)
Finish up the two entities created for the Time Controller, test out it's ai more thoroughly, also ensure that it changes modes properly (it doesn't need to save them when unloaded
and reloaded because it's health resets when this happens anyway)
Added a flag that makes it shift modes when in present mode immediately after it's health dips below half, it regenerates at 3 different rates for each time mode it can be in
Added some extra parameters to the Time Disruption entity that makes it stay alive up to a certain amount of time then it dies
Fixed a few game crashes with the Time Bomb and Time Disruption
The Time Controller is really deadly especially when it uses the Time Disruptions, it's model looks kinda meh right now but I plan on making it better (along with all of the other
bosses/mobs) in the future, including when I actually do animations for them
Fixed a few issues with the alternate abilities of a few of the weapons as they were doing their effects client-side instead of server-side
Added all of the items and such for the Time Disruptor to summon the Time Controller
Added the Time Disruptor block, which can be placed to randomize the time of day as well as to summon the Time Controller (also requires iron blocks, will alter the block recipe to
use something other than iron as that is a lot of iron required)
The recipe now requires one nether star and a ruby and sapphire block
Made it so that Time Controller glows in the dark (lol), also implemented this on the Cryse and Mega-Cryse
Added some visual effects so that people can tell what time phase it's in, it goes dark when it's in past mode and it gains bright flashy colors when in future mode
Still need to implement a few other things like the model for the TimeDisruption and the render for the Time Bomb (client-side things)
Added horns to the vanilla cow's drops
Adjusted the Mourning Star's recipe

0.26.881
Added texture for Polaris, subject to future revision but good enough for now, changed spawn egg colors for the bosses
Attempted a render effect for Polaris when it's dark but it's not working for some reason
Adjusted boss drop rates (lowered a lot)
Made alternative doom abilities not use doom when player is in creative mode
Converted other previous weapon abilities to alternative doom abilities, ensured that they do not use doom if in creative mode
Slightly altered Death Reaper's texture
Modified Nor-Vox's model to allow for the creation of a texture, added texture for it (subject to change)
Fixed minor localization issue with Death Reaper's spawn egg
Added a utility method in WorldHelper that allows you to get a static random type
Added another utility method that allows you to get the difficulty of the current world (while not exactly time-saving it is still useful to have)
Altered Time Controller's damage when in contact with a player to ensure the player is not in creative mode to damage them
After updating to the new recommended Forge version, it's now complaining about the packets being memory leaks, due to this I will rewrite the net code to counter this
This will also push back the interim update I was going to release, meaning it'll be a while before I have another release
Because of this, I want the Dimensional code working (and stable) and I also want the network code to work completely fine, also for the dimensional code I would like to have all
of the biomes in it generate properly as well as update the models/textures of the mobs and add some animations, this could also involve an ai rewrite 
This would bring the mod pretty close to a 1.0.0 release (it would reset the version numbers as well, but maintain the new versioning system)

0.27.905 [Start of the Tragic Dimension and rewrite of the net code] (June 16, 2014)
Started creating basic dimension things such as a chunk provider, world chunk manager and world provider. I'll do tests with it soon (I just have to figure out how to register the
Dimension and such to begin with in regards to the initialization events)
Added the registrations for the Dimension into the init, I'll make a temporary item that teleports you there (or just use the Dimensional key that I created the texture for), to
ensure that it works, there will be spam from the network code but I'll rewrite that soon
I'll have to send a packet from the client to the server to say that the player is changing dimensions (I'll copy code from the nether/end portal for this I guess)
Added the ability for you to teleport with the Celestial Longbow if you're sneaking when you right click initially
Added the Dimensional Key, it should allow me to test out the new dimension (which I'll actually test on a day when I've gotten sleep) by letting me attempt to teleport to it
Added a basic network wrapper to the main class, I'll now go through and implement each packet I created previously as a message instead of a packet and create a message handler to
do so, this will be a bit more complicated than using the packet pipeline but it should work just as effectively
Fixed some minor issues with the Messages (they require an open constructor) and also fixed an issue with the message handler (return null when the message was successfully received
I'm fairly sure previously it was just bouncing the message back and forth before)
Otherwise, no further memory leaks reported and it works well so successful rewrite of the net code
Working on getting the dimension to properly work but for now the dimensional key only teleports me to the nether instead of the dimension so there may be an issue with that
There was an issue with the chunk manager for the dimension so I've defaulted it to the normal overworld chunk generation, as a result of this, it now works properly so I'll ensure
that it loads up and works properly every time then I'll begin modifying code to make it use my custom biomes instead along with custom block generation (not just dirt and stone, but
maybe dark stone and dead dirt)
Made it so that normal mobs could transform into mini-bosses if they are left in the world too long without being killed (over 500 seconds, this should be very rare)
Added a lesser form variable to my mobs/mini-bosses to optimize their targetting and to avoid mobs in their own lineage
Added creative mode only weapons, the sword of justice and the bow of justice (reference to Etho here)
Added the new bosses to the summon blocks (forgot to do so)
There was a chunk error in the dimension so hopefully it was just a fluke and isn't going to occur every time
Fixed some server-side issues with the new netcode that I'm using
Added the ability to pull players towards the Time Controller when it's in present mode, that should give it a bit more uniqueness while in that mode

0.27.918
Going to work on setting the Dimension up how I want for this point release, afterwards I'll work on the dimension-specific content (weapons/mobs/structures)
Found out that the chunk errors were due to me incorrectly setting a long integer in the chunk manager, I set it to system time when it was actually seed, so this resulted in
a variable seed to generate from
Removed console spam from Jarra when is spawns poison barbs, reduced amount of poison barbs it spawns per 20 ticks when angered
Removed a lot of console spam from various classes, added a logger to my main class so that I can use it to ensure of certain things during initialization, it also logs errors and
should show up in any crash reports related to them
I'll start experimenting with the Dimension properties later on
Removed mineshafts, strongholds and villages from dimension generation, I only want dungeons, ravines and caves to generate from vanilla
Trying to find out how to only set a specific set of biomes to generate in it, I'll have to do something similar to the nether/end generation to obtain this result I'm guessing
I may have to ask the forge forums on how I would do this actually, but I'll have to wait until I actually get internet back...
Made it so that you hold down right click with the Dimensional Key in order to teleport to the Tragic Dimension, it'll teleport you back the overworld if used in the Dimension, you
can teleport from other dimensions to the Tragic Dimension with it
Modified the seed for the new dimension in order to make it at least look different from the overworld generation, which it is based off of currently
Removing the magic aspects of the mod, this'll simplify mob stats and removes the need to fix it, for now I'll just disable it in the config (without giving the ability to the player
to toggle it on), doing testing now to ensure that it works right without it
Made it so that Immunity now prevents you from being stunned
Reduced rate that the Minotaur charges at the player
Increased damage taken from the Minotaur and Apis that is not projectile damage
Made it so that Mega Cryse damages players just by touching them, in addition to it's normal attack and reflection ability
Made it so that the Bow and Sword of Justice are actually one-hit kills
Doing some experimentation with the test chunk manager, changing biomes and such
I'll probably implement a Test Dimension alongside the Tragic Dimension (I'll keep it the way it is until the experimentation with the test dimension bears fruit, really juicy ones)

0.27.926
Updated the tab icons
Adding my custom biomes now, hopefully I'll be able to make them only generate in my dimension, but I may (as I said before) have to ask someone how to make it only generate them 
for my dimension
Maybe there's a problem with biome registration, trying a few methods to register biomes now
Using the BiomeManager added the biomes successfully to the overworld, but I'm attempting to add them only to my dimension so I'm trying a few other things
Messing with custom GenLayers now, seems like this is how biomes are selected based on coordinates and length/width of the biome, as well as neighbouring biomes, however, I can't
quite tell which integer in the functions actually determines the biomes
Slightly altered structure generation, added a few more blocks to the allowed structure replaceable blocks, added obsidian cavern generation to my dimension
Changed Time Disruptor summon "structure" to use Quartz blocks instead of iron blocks, this should make it more viable for the player to go to the nether
Added chest generation from structures to the logger, other things still use system out but this is only temporary
Made it so that the time disruptor block needs to be powered by redstone or another power source in order to do it's time disruption, as long as it's powered it'll change the time
once per tick
Renamed Time Disruptor to Time Disruption Cube (better name)
Added Minotaur and Ragr to dungeon spawners, Minotaur one is uncommon, Ragr one is rare

0.27.940 (June 19, 2014)
Made it so that magic damage ignores Mega Cryse's shields, reduced recharge time of it's shields to 5 seconds from when the first one is broken
Increased reflected damage from Mega Cryse, reduced Mega Cryse and Cryse's normal attack damage
Increased chance of reflection to occur with the Time Controller in past mode
Optmized structure generation a bit by eliminating some redundancy in the code, it still requires some more optimization but that's for another time
Updated to a new Forge release, build 10.12.2.1126 (this will start a pattern of me noting these when I do updates)
Changed Plague mob to die automatically after being alive for a minute, increased spawn rate of them slightly
Created new model for the Mega Cryse, it'll look similar to a Magneton (from Pokemon) it'll reuse the Cryse texture, except maybe slightly more blue
Slightly adjusted Time Controller's Hitbox to be larger, adjusted Mega Cryse's hitbox to match it's model more
Optimized ore decrease world generator some, should work more efficiently now
Changed Shifting Sands to Lunar Powder, utilizing an older texture I made, Celestial Metal is now Celestial Diamond
Added textures for most of the new items (low res) and for the Tungsten Jack, whih is a recolor of the Ender Jack
Another possible for use of Star Pieces could be for Cooldown Defuses, Time Essence could also be used for Amulet Releases and Doom Consumes
Disabled mod magic calculations and stuff since it was a sorta broken system, may get reintroduced in a simpler form later on
Rediscovered ore gen events, I may have to create a custom biome decorator too in order to alter ore generation the way I want, as well as affect other world things
It's becoming frustrating trying to change the biomes for the dimension, I'll have to look online at some code to try to find a way to do this, meanwhile I think I'll revert it back
to the normal overworld generation and do a release
Increased Cryse's health to 35, Mega Cryse's was increased to 50

0.27.948
Added light/dark armor textures, just for the items not for the rendered armor
Debugging an issue with the amulet inventory now (was previously fixed but the updated netcode broke it again), it is apparently not in sync with the proper container or inventories
or something is not being called server-side that should be
Adapted some code from the previous netcode in order to fix the amulet inventory (again)
Reverted the experimental chunk management for the Dimension, prepping for a release with it in it's current state, but I need to add more of the structures, add the boss-related
mobs as well as finish the two entities I created for the Time Controller (Time Disruption and Time Bomb)
Updated some tile entity code that was utilizing getAABBPool(), which is deprecated in 1.7.10
Updated a lot of entity code using vec3Pool due to it's deprecation in 1.7.10
Added tough leather to the Minotaur's rare drops
Added a sky to the dimension (previously used no sky) but the mob spawning is still constant, which is how I want
Set most overworld mob buffs to only apply in my dimension, nether mobs still get their buffs regardless
Doing some experimenting with using a custom biome cache and utilizing a custom biomegenbase class, I'll see what this does
Caused some crashes, ultimately I think I'll need to use something like the Nether/End chunk provider, and modify it to suit what I need, the Biome Cache may be the way to
do things if I do indeed want a dimension that uses my custom biomes
Looking into some mods code on github to see how other dimensional mods are set up, this will greatly help in my understanding of it
Added an interface for threaded doomsdays, this reduces extra code in all of the doomsday classes, only using the methods in the doomsdays that need them

0.28.962 [Made it so that my dimension only uses my biomes, fleshing out biomes, adding more uniqueness to the dimension]
Adapting some dimensional code from a github I found, this utilizes minimum changes to my code that I had already written, mostly I'm just adding code from their custom GenLayers
but I may also add some of their Teleporter code (I haven't quite learned how the teleporter code is utilized, but I'll look into it and utilize it)
Utilizing code adapted from the custom genlayers, utilizing the custom biomes in my dimension has been successful
Changed biome gen to look for dark stone to generate the top blocks, converted all normal stone that generates to dark stone blocks, the oceans were changed to lava
Made it so that the dimension time is always at midnight, it is a dark dimension but there is a lot of lava to light it up, planning on adding things like glowstone to help brighten
it up some as well
Fixed an issue brought up when entities are attacked, game crash caused because of a nullcheck not being done before, this was due to me moving code for vanilla mobs when they
are in my dimension or aren't
Reverted change to "ocean" level, since everything in generation is made around that level
Removed vanilla ore generation from my dimension, I may use this to reduce vanilla ore gen in the overworld as well
Lowered spawn rate of Ice Golems in cold biomes
I need to update my custom world generation to use the dark stone blocks instead of normal stone and remove vanilla ore generation, I'm also going to add a world generation feature
that has the stone layered in different stone types at y = 128 and lower, in the future I want the layers to change each seed but for now I'll just make them generate at specific 
y values, each layer won't be a different stone type, it'll just break up the monotony of dark stone underground and such
Trying to make sure the spawn point is above ground (that it doesn't set it inside the ground)
Added recipes for the dimensional key and for the obsidian block variants
Increased amount of obsidian orbs you get from crafting
Messing with a custom teleporter and using the proper way to teleport between dimensions (I think), there is an issue with it creating platforms every time you enter the dimension
but otherwise it should be fine
The pre-releases for the 1.7.10 version are being worked on by Forge, so I'll try to ensure compatibility with 1.7.2 and 1.7.10 when that happens (also the version number will become
1.7.10-0.2x.xxx)
Removed Obsidian Caverns from the overworld generation, it is now dimension-specific

0.28.976 (June 26, 2014)
Removed Rune Walker and Rune Break from enchantments, also removed the Hornet Amulet, this was due to me removing magic and as such these have no purpose, so if I ever reimplement
magic, they'll be re-added or they may be reworked into something else
Fixed bug with putting ladders to lead down to the obsidian cavern from the surface, it should now generate properly, also increased size of the bottom cavern to have more space to
fight bosses/mobs that may spawn or be placed there
I'm going to work on finishing the obsidian caverns now, then I'll work on the biomes
Starting to add cavern offerings as well as setting up the structure seed to be able to choose a specific combination rather than a randomized one
Updated to Forge 10.12.2.1147, this should stop the system hangs when closing out of the client or trying to quit the server
Added world generation for void pitfalls, testing frequency now, added world gen for ores in the dimension
Adjusting spawn point, should now put you at the highest valid block possible, otherwise it generates a platform and air pocket for you
Void pitfalls now work almost exactly how I want, there's only two sizes right now (large and small)
Ore generation looks good so far, so I'll work on making custom ore blocks for them all now (I'll make one new block that contains all of them through metadata)
Added all of the ore blocks in one block, changed the world gen to use this, added an xp ore block that just gives xp when mined (it gives a lot of xp)
May edit the textures a tiny bit (color contrast) but otherwise should be fine
Apparently there is some rewrites regarding the config in order to allow users to edit these while the game is running, this will be another huge rewrite to my code to adjust for it
when it is fully implemented
Hopefully I can also come up for a better system with the blanket configurations instead of doing it manually (it's not very efficient and is totally open to my own derpy errors)
Messing with a 2nd config just for trying to find a more efficient way, maybe I could use the configuration categories and have each blanket config toggle every config in a specific
category
Trying to find the world where I made the obsidian structure openings!
Modified the teleporter to use spawn point coordinates as well as the top solid block of these coordinates to teleport you

0.28.984 (June 29, 2014)
Can't find the world where I made the obsidian structure openings :C
In the future, setup my mobs to utilize ichun's hat and morph mod, I'm always up for cross-mod compatibility and a lot of ppl use these mods
Disabled mud generation, quicksand and nether drudge generation are still active
Consolidated all of the old ore generation into two classes, one for the overworld and one for the nether (they don't need to be separate but it's more organized that way)
Added a default option for obsidian caverns to generate with one chest in the middle
Converted most of the console spam to actually use the logger, these will be disabled once I'm done with structure generation
Testing out biome generation with normal world type, we'll see how it looks and compare it
Making basic biome classes (just height/variation numbers for now)
Reverted to amplified terrain due to some weird generation with the normal terrain gen
Added mushroom generation (small mushrooms, not the large ones) to the decaying biomes as well as dead bush generation, the void pits will be only for the decaying biomes at this
point, may expand to other biomes in the future
Fixed bug with Doom not updating on the gui when you restart the game or change dimensions
Adding a bone block, so that I can create some structures to give the decaying biomes more variety (bone altars, skeletons, etc.), I'll also probably add a few ambient creatures
such as skeletings (tiny skeleton creatures) for the biome as well, they will come in variants also (a bat-like skeleting, a small quadruped skeleting, a baby skeleton skeleting)
Thinking of adding bone meal ore to the decaying biomes, after I maybe add a few more "unique" things to these biomes, I'll move on to the next biome set

1.28.1000 (July 3, 2014) <Updated to 1.7.10, also commit 1000!>
Did some research on the forge forums about the new features, I'll probably start setting up the config gui stuff after I do the config rewrite, or I'll do them simultaneously
when I have nothing else major to do (it's not that high of a priority)
I also looked at some things about creating more complex entity models, I'll probably do all of that as one of the last updates before a stable actual release build
Added a few more random options for the obsdian cavern generation since I learned how to use my own mobs in the vanilla mob spawners, it uses most of my normal mobs
Added some extra code in my mob's superclass that prevents them from targetting other mobs of the same type, mini-bosses may still target mobs of their weaker version's type and mobs
like the Ragr may still target their own mob type
Fixed bug with my mobs generating from mob spawners, removed extraneous world variable in superclass
Need to add some chest hooks for the obsdian caverns, probably a lot of amulets, cooldown defuses and rare items to counter the danger from some of the randomized cavern offerings
Added structure seeds for the obsidian caverns, it has one randomized option and 4 preset options, modified the preset ones a bit
I may have to do some small rewrites to the dimension biome code to ensure that the biome sets generate near each other rather than randomly, similar to
Inverted qualifier for teleporter to create a spawn platform, it should now prevent the player from spawning in lava on teleport to dimension if lava is in the spawn coordinates
Working on obsidian cavern openings right now, removed logger spam from generating bone spikes, improved criteria for when they generate so that they don't generate in the air as
much (they still do sometimes)
Improved criteria for bone spikes to generate again, trying to resolve the issue of the obsidian cavern ladder not generating up to the top when it has a cave opening generated
Adjusted criteria for Ragr to spawn in the dimension, so that it can spawn in obsidian dungeons, also allows it to spawn at any height in the dimension
Adjusted bounding boxes of most of the mobs and bosses
Slightly adjusted textures for most of the dimension ores, as well as adjusted all of the tungsten textures to be more consistent
Increased generation rate of xp ore in the dimension
Created new textures for the red mercury and tungsten blocks, added reaper skull cavern opening to the obsidian caverns
Added "layered" world generation for my dimension so that the stone blocks generate with variants in specific layers
This will pick specific layers dependent on the seed of the world, but each chunk will have very slight variations on the seed's layer pattern
This will be disabled for now until I create new blocks to use for this (will probably replace the cracked and faded dark stone variants and put in a few new ones)
Updated to 1.7.10, Forge version 10.13.0.1160, fixed a few vec3 errors that I missed, there are some issues with getting a pet owner's name and setting them as owner but I can look
into the vanilla code to see the new ways to set these, not a priority at this moment
Updated jdk to the newest public release version, fixed error from updating due to incorrect arguments from forge
Set default confguration of keep dimension loaded to false, should reduce overall lag as it's a large dimension to keep loaded at all times

1.28.1015 (July 5, 2014)
Set up Kitsune Den's structure generation, may have to create it's own generation for it as it'll generate randomly like the vanilla mob dungeons
Changed the normal structure generation to attempt all structure types for each spot that is chosen by the world generator
Removed loops in the structure world generator as they didn't make sense and reduced efficiency of the generator, also set the kitsune den to have it's own unique generation within
the structure world generator so that another class would not have to be made
Added schematic for the Polaris obsidian cavern opening
Setup the Celestial Temple and Time Altar in the structure class, very, very basic, still need to set up their basic schematic classes and add them to the structure world generator
Began basic setup for chest hooks in the obsidian caverns, it's going to take a while to ensure each chest gets the proper generation
I also need to update the chest hooks to have more variety
Sometime soon, I need to add all of the recipes for upgrading amulets to their higher levels
Lowered amulets damage to 300 base value, this means that lvl 1 amulets will get around 100 uses, and lvl 2 will get around 150, lvl 3 will get around 300, lvl 4 will get around 300 as
well
Removed Tragic Neko from overworld, it will now be dimension-specific (it will spawn in all but a few biomes in the dimension)
Added NEI to my development workspace so that I'll be able to see recipes easier and have the ability to add other mods to my workspace, also added damage indicators mod for clarity
in damage done to and from mobs
Added chest generation for the obsidian caverns, still need to make the schematics for the last two openings and then start on the schematics for the kitsune den, celestial temple
and time altar
Added the ore charms to the ore dictionary, now I can use these in shapeless recipes to upgrade amulets, will be able to combine two same level amulets plus a charm or combine an
amulet with an awakening stone to level it up, you cannot combine two amulets of different levels
May make it that you can combine amulet types to create new unobtainable ones (would remove me needing to actually create new items for each new amulet as well)
Added the first epic amulet, the Time Amulet, it basically acts like magnetism from other mods in that you pull items on the ground towards you, as it is an epic amulet, it has
infinite durability (in that it doesn't cost durability to do the effect)
Fixed bug with amulet inventory not properly updating the client (again)
Removed some extra packets from being sent so that the server/client don't get too overloaded, reduced it even more for the amulet inventory updates to only send once per 20 ticks
Added new textures for Ruby, Sapphire, Tungsten and Light/Dark Ingots, Quicksilver Ingot name changed to Solidified Quicksilver
Changed most calls to random to use the main class's Random instance, this should improve the speed a tiny bit, also made most of these references private, the Doomsday class one is
set to protected as it is a superclass
Adjusted minimum and maximum amount of items to generate from my chest hooks, altered the chest hooks to use the actual chestgen class instead of my subclass, this is due to an update
in Forge that actually changes it's constructor to be public
Updated to Forge 10.13.0.1170, this contains a lot of opengl fixes so hopefully it'll fix a few issues with my mobs rendering
Working on setting up a github, this changelog will not be a part of it as it is intended for private use only (even though a copy is with each version of the mod as it is part of
the mod files
This is in favor of setting up actual commits and build numbers
In other news, I may also create a mod on the side that alters vanilla mobs and sets their texture and abilities based on the biome they spawn in, i.e. ice zombies, jungle spiders,
mountain skeletons, cave sheep, tree cows, etc.

1.28.1040 <138> (July 7, 2014)
Finished the last two cave openings for the obsidian caverns, it should be complete now (barring future additions of variations to it)
Added a new set of blocks for the Kitsune Den, these are netherrack variations and also contains the foxtail rock
Added more block variants of dark stone, including beveled versions of each variant, the non-beveled versions are added to the ore dictionary as replacements for stone
Added recipes for the smooth netherrack blocks, all of them are craftable (very easily as well since they use netherrack as their main component and there's tons of that available)
Added recipes for the beveled dark stone variants
Added recipes for Tungsten Armor
Added recipes for Harmony Bell and Gravity Spike
Added recipe for Candles
Added recipe for Everlasting Light
These recipes were added previously but something must've happened to erase them
Slightly increased amount of blocks that Miner Skills mines, it mines a large area, but it doesn't mine a consistent enough area, so I may change this to utilize a more novice approach
by selecting blocks out of an area and having a 1 in 100 chance to not destroy a block
This marks the first version that I'll split off of 1.7.2 compatibility, I'll maintain both versions up until I do a release then I'll focus only on the 1.7.10 version
Reduced overall chance for structures to generate
Adjusted layered stone generation to have more layers above the normal limit and such to make sure that if the world dependency is really low, it still generates some layers at 
higher elevations
Increased amount of stone variants that generate at each layer, reduced range and chunk variation of each layer so that they generate at consistent layers throughout the world
Increased ore generation chance for all of the ores in the dimension
Fixed some npes, mostly involving icon arrays and metadata values for my metadata blocks, there's some wonkiness going on with the bone block meta, as well as with the molten nether
block, but at least they won't crash the game (this may just be a forge or nei issue)
Fixed an npe due to the net code trying to read nbt data that is null
Added the new structures to the world generation, I still need to create the schemtics for the Kitsune Den, Celestial Temple and Time Altar but now they should generate properly
Added config options for the new structures, did some reordering of the structure gen to give more weight to the less common structures
Structure seeds for the new structures should be set up, still need to add their schematics, created new texture for the structure seeds
Created schematic for the Kitsune Den, it'll generate with a central den that has a Kitsune spawner, then has a chance to generate up to 4 more dens around it that contain jabba
spawners, each of these generates with one chest under them
The outer dens generate with extra blocks on the outside of them (and a few misplaced blocks), but this is a minor issue (and I don't feel like fixing it right now)
Set the decaying biomes to use the wasteland as their superclass, added a few vanilla mobs to their mob list in order to add some variety in mob generation to them
Added Plague to all of my biomes spawnable mob list, it uses config options
Added Jabba and Gragul to the decaying biomes spawn list, they use config options
Changed amulet level up recipes to require Amulet Release instead of Awakening Stones

1.28.1055 <139> (July 14, 2014)
Added Overgrown biomes (soon to be renamed)
Increased biome size in the biome gen layer, this just means larger biomes
Added Painted blocks for the Painted biomes (renamed from the overgrown biomes), this will include at least 2 new tree types, one painted, one other that is stained or lackered and
maybe one more that is a pink version of the painted one, or it could use birch wood as it's base, Bleached wood maybe
Fixed initial issues with the leaf block, I don't know if they'll work like normal leaves in regards to decaying and such but at least they look right
Added the painted wood and planks to the ore dictionary so that they can be used in vanilla recipes, added their names for localization
Added two tree types for the painted trees, one based on an oak tree and one based on a jungle tree
Updated to Forge 10.13.0.1180
Added variants to the painted biomes, these mainly adjust the amount of vegetation that spawns, but the clearing will have the most flowers, the plains will have the most shrubs
and tall grass and the hills will just have a higher elevation
Added painted tall grass and world gen for painted shrubs, added these to the painted biomes
Added 16 new flowers for use in future biomes, these are subject to texture and plant type change, but will mostly be used for my biomes
Fixed problems with the saplings and flower textures, set their itemblocks to extend itemblock with metadata, which fixed their itemblock rendering due to how flowers are rendered
in-game
Made it so that the new flowers grow in overworld biomes (forests, extreme hills, taigas, plains, roofed forest, jungles), this is a configurable option, they will not grow if
bonemeal is used and some only grow in specific biomes, the stapelia spawns in all biomes but is very rare
Added Guilty Thorn recipe, it uses vines from the ore dictionary
Added Glowvine recipe, it uses vanilla vines along with glowstone dust but is "unfairly" expensive, this is to push the player to go to the dimension to harvest them
The flowers use a boolean discriminator based on biome location to determine the proper flowers to allow to generate in specific biomes
Removed most mobs from spawning other than the Plague and Tragic Neko
There will be a release at this build for 1.7.2 and 1.7.10 now

1.28.1072 <140> (July 15, 2014)
I have determined the cause of the extreme lag is the new biomes, this will probably be because of the leaves, vines, and lighting updates
Altered the leaves and vines to not get random tick updates, but it is still quite laggy
Removed the light from the leaves, this greatly reduced the lag, however, chunks still render oddly (this may actually be a forge or vanilla thing), re-enabled random tick updates
Added a new method that my custom biomes will use that will allow my custom flower generator to only generate my flowers in the dimension (mushrooms will still generate the same)
Updated a deprecated call for a forge event in the chunk provider
Set up a github for this, hello world
Working on setting up my new version of my config for blanket configurations to make it easier, previously it was open to a lot of my derps and it also added on to the workload of
Forge during the preInit phase, it's going to be a real pain switching over to the new config with all of the options and all of the things that use it
Updated to Forge 10.12.13.1183, there was some opengl errors but this was due to another program I had open
Reduced logger spam for structure generation, it will now only say when a structure is generated
Added new Ashen biomes, these will probably look like a cross between the decaying and painted biomes, except more varied vegetation
Added Ashen and Bleached Trees, and the blocks to make them, all of the log blocks have a small amount of light that they emit, this is fine since the dimension is naturally dark
Sometime soon, set up singular classes for leaves, planks, logs so that there is less block classes, a class each one can call and just have a string set in the constructor to change
or set them up as metadata blocks (which would mess up some world gen with them)
Updated the ashen biome class to actually use the ashen trees/shrubs and have the bleached one as less common in the lower height biome variants
Made it so that the painted tall grass emits a tiny bit of light
Reduced overall chance for structures to generate in my dimension
Reduced chance for void pits to generate in the dimension (they cause a lot of lag)
Updated flower world gen, fixed an aob exception (derp) and made it so that more tree types can grow from the tragic sapling
Updated dimension to add the ashen biome set, ignoring volcano biome for now
Last release I said was the last 1.7.2 update, but because of the state I released the dimension in for it, I'll do at least one more update for it (though based on downloads
alone it seems to be more popular than the 1.7.10 version currently so maybe I'll parallel the updates for a couple updates
Fixed weird issue where the decaying biomes would get snow generation because of rain (hopefully)

1.28.1081 <141> (July 20, 2014)
Reorganized biome and world gen classes, there will be a rewrite of the structure gen class at some point to utilize the schematic interface properly
Worked on optimizing overall world gen again, did a few small changes to improve load time, started setting up something to ensure that the chunks near you always render while
you're in the dimension, but I'll fully test that out when I get home
Made it so that you can bonemeal my flowers now to get more of them, about a 1 in 4 chance to get a flower from them, I'll make it even less common with the rarer flower types
Added recipes for all of my flowers to convert them into dyes, except the stapelia which can be turned into glowstone dust
Testing out a new method in world helper, it may be of use for new entity attacks/effects, going to fill in the other methods soon as well
Created a new tree, this is the Bleached Tree, it will usually generate as a large oddly shaped tree with a large flat leaves shape
Updated Tragic Sapling with custom code rather than extending vanilla, it should now actually work when bone mealed but will not work if planted normally (not yet anyway)
Fixed some crashes associated with no longer extending BlockSapling, updated world generators in main class to make room for more if needed
Changed Bleached Log and Ashen Sapling's textures

1.28.1090 <142> (July 24, 2014)
Fixed incompatibility with BoP, which extended the potion type array and didn't throw up my flag that the mod should not load potions due to that
Working on optimizing the dimension's world generation, this also includes changing biome generation and utilizing biome weights to make some biomes more common and some less common
Fix worldgen issue from updating the tragic sapling code, this should now allow trees to generate again
Fixing some other small worldgen issues like the painted clearing generating shrubs when it shouldn't be and the ashen biomes having odd terrain gen due to the gen layer experimenting
Increased chance for dead dirt shields to generate in the ashen badlands, this gives it a more "rugged" feel
Attempting to make it that if the player spawns within a pool of lava then walls are generated around them to protect them
Attempted fix for chests in the Apis stucture generating with "ghost" items (items generated on the client side but not in the server, so they aren't actually there)
Altered Nether Drudge generation to generate it only in the midranges of the nether, updated brushed grass texture to better match the painted biome color palette
Attempting to fix some small terrain generation issues with the biomes
Thinking of reverting to normal world generation, this would require slight adjustments to the high y-level ore gen ranges
Modified some doom event stuff to reduce events used, there will be a consolidation of events soon for all of the events I use as it is way too difficult to find specific events to
change whenever I need to find them

1.29.1108++ [Added Starlit biomes, reorganized a lot of classes, rework dimension to use default terrain type] <143> (July 28, 2014)
Experimenting with biome gen layers again
Slight fix to a utility method
Fixing some things with biomes like biome height generation
Reworked void pit generation, it utilizes the new utility method to reduce lag and increase the speed of it's generation, currently changing it up to make it look a bit more natural
I'm going to add a creative mode only item, void pit generator just cuz I can (and it's creative mode only), it'll generate void pits in the world when you right click a spot
Removed extraneous item classes, these all now use the ItemGeneric class
Removed BlockMeta, this was initially a test for creating metadata blocks that I never deleted
Reimplemented void pit world gen reduction, it was removed and I forgot to readd it
Added the ashen biomes ids to the config
Changed the bleached tree world gen, hopefully it'll actually generate sometimes
Added boulder world gen, this was to give the ashen biomes a more "rough" feeling, but it didn't seem to mesh with the ashen biomes that much so I'll shelve it for now
Testing out reverting to normal world gen, it actually slightly improved loading time of the world but I need to adjust the biome heights (and ore gen levels) if I'm going to keep it
like that (leaning towards keeping it, it'll still generate amplified if the user chooses that), also for some reason the ashen biomes still generate with weird terrain problems
Fixed some potentional npes when some mobs/bosses were disabled, including summon blocks for disabled bosses, spawners in structures for disabled mobs/bosses
Added Starlit biome set, this will generate very high y levels, they will have a pink/purple color scheme
Created a generic grass block class for my grass blocks, going to create a generic block type for each block I currently have that will have varieties due to biomes (logs, tall
grass, planks, leaves, bushes, etc.)
Maybe in the future I'll also add slabs and stairs for each new wood type
Remove unneeded datawatchers for the player, though the current doom and cooldown would be best to use for those, I don't think it's necessary to have them (they also cause mod
incompatibilities with other mods and is just generally annoying to deal with)
Removed more unnecessary block classes, made these generic classes that I can use for future blocks, made sapphire and ruby (nether variants) have the same harvest level, requiring
a diamond pickaxe or better to obtain
Changed texture of Starlit Grass to be lighter
Adding tall grass and bleached tree world gen to the starlit biomes now, also added star crystal world gen
Removed unused WorldGens (Balloon tree and boulder), added starlit biomes to the actual config

1.29.1124 <144> (July 30, 2014)
Mess with turning starlit crystals into "easter egg" like formations, this is just for fun
Fix derp with ashen biomes terrain generating weirdly (used wrong block in grass generation, derp derp derp)
Setup rugged terrain generation for ashen biomes because I actually sorta liked the rough look they had due to that derp, though maybe not as profound ruggedness
Some small rewrite to rugged terrain so that it'll only generate on top of solid blocks (not tall grass, leaves or air)
Reduced tree generation in badlands a bit to allow for more roughness to the terrain
Added dead bush gen to decaying biomes to give them a bit more variety in their appearance
Slightly modified star crystal gen to allow more chances for them to generate, removed logger spam for it and the bleached tree
About to start working on experimental biomes, these will use very little vanilla generation and will use my own custom world gen to create their specific biome features, these will
take a lot of code to create
There is a bug with "picking" the starlit crystal blocks, this is due to how the meta is set up for their drops, I'd have to rearrange their meta value to match with the dyes in
order to fix this
Create more detailed crash reports for a couple of instances where a crash report is necessary, fix an npe when potions are disabled, remove extra try-catch at dimension registration
and instead set it to attempt to register under a new id
Add Time Altar schematic and apply to structure seeds and structure world gen
Doing some adjustments to the sphere world helper to try to give it more of a circular shape rather than a blocky spherical shape (I know it's minecraft but still lol)
Added a group of creative mode only items for testing and for fun, these include a void pit generator, sphere generator, sphere eraser, tree generator and a wand to make mobs fight
each other
The neko neko wand worked initially but now for some reason it doesn't, I'll have to look into this more I guess, I'll mark it as WIP until I can get it resolved
The sphere util method works more efficiently at the cost of more processor power required to do the computations, as such any world gen that uses the sphere util method will be
laggier

1.30.1134 [Updated netcode to allow for (mostly) stable SMP play] <145> (July 31, 2014)
Worked on fixing up message handlers and messages when playing on a server, there seems to be some wonky issues with the network wrapper it seems
Updated network wrapper to use proxy based player finding, which resolves most server issues
This also necessitated a fix to doomsdays, making them a client-side check that is sent to the server to do the doomsday
I had to create a new message to do this, and remove a lot of doomsday code from my current weapons/armor/items
This broke threaded doomsdays, but small changes fixed this issue
Now using specials only requires the player to click the use special button, the special abilities are reserved to right-click and right-click + sneaking
This brings forth the fact that the threaded doomsdays cause game crashes on the server, I'll have to make more safeguards for this it seems, although the crash is not very common
Added a couple of safeguards for the threaded doomsdays, the try/catch clauses will probably never be called but I'll keep them there anyway
Change accepted minecraft version to use the EXACT minecraft version inputted, this will stop people from trying to use the 1.7.2 version on 1.7.10 forge
Reduced amount of doom messages sent to player to one per 4 ticks rather than one per tick, this is part of my goal to reduce lag and optimize code

1.30.1149 <146> (August 1, 2014)
Made it so that painted and brushed grass can spread to other blocks
All of my grass blocks will be turned into dead dirt if a solid block is placed on top of them
Remove stray method call in the Inkling's ai, it was calling the summon help method even though it's supposed to be disabled
Optimized the util method in the WorldHelper to reduce lag
Updated the Star Crystal Worldgen to create better crystal shapes, created new spike worldgen that creates massive spikes, this will be used in the tainted spikes biome and in the
decaying biomes
Made new creative mode only items for the star crystal worldgen and the new spike worldgen
Added new block types
Fix meta values for pick block with the star crystal blocks, changed the star crystal world gen now to use all of the meta values
Apply rarity to the Sword and Bow of Justice
Optimized worldgen for Spikes a bit, made it so that the decaying biomes get extra per chunk
Fixed block name issue with Eroded Stone
Removed some more extraneous block classes, the various leaves block classes and the giant potato/carrot classes, these were consolidated into two classes
Reworked the BlockWax class into a generic block class, this is for single block types that have no special properties (may be purely aesthetic, for instance) but without metadata
Attempting to make my custom leaf blocks use the proper texture based on if fancy graphics are enabled or not, but it seems a bit buggy currently
Reverted leaf blocks to use the previous rendering
Simplified all of the ItemBlock classes using a superclass, I was hoping to be able to delete all of the itemblock classes and just use a main one with constructors allowing for
instanciation of the itemblocks during registration of the blocks, but the result didn't work as intended but I'll retain the superclass setup
Added new dead dirt variants (it was going to happen eventually), rugged dirt will generate in the ashen biomes now, mixed dead dirt will now generate in dark stone to give it
some variety, as well as generate in patches in decaying biomes
WorldGen is really laggy for me in the Dimension, but this may be due to my video card (it really sucks and I'm using a laptop), either way I'm still going to work on optimizing
WorldGen and reducing amount of calculations done per tick for mobs

1.31.1164 [Optimize WorldGen, this makes loading the dimension way faster, some SSP fixes for the new netcode] <147> (August 4, 2014)
Testing load times when removing some WorldGen features, this is to see which is causing the most lag, I'm fairly sure it's the dimension layers and void pit worldgen causing the
most lag
Fix bug with Star Crystals, left out a meta value when I changed them so that it resulted in an AoB exception when that value was called in Worldgen
Fix Spike WorldGen, they now actually generate, the tainted spike biome looks awesome as well
Changed Tainted Spike biome to use the new Eroded Stone instead of Dark Cobblestone as the top block, we'll see how this looks
Fix NPE with Pumpkinhead, it was using a client-side only method (I didn't know it was client-side only)
Changed a bunch of internal and unlocalized names, these were bothering me
Optimized a lot of WorldGen to reduce the amount of things generated in each chunk, this greatly increased chunk-loading times
Changed how decaying biomes spikes are regressed, it should now fit in closer to star crystal worldgen as I used some variables from it
Adjusted structure worldgen rates as they were set too rare, especially in the dimension
Altered Time Altar structure slightly, should fix offset of air created to give it space and also adjusts size of star crystals generated in it
Slight fix to client-side rendering of threaded doomsdays that spawn in entities
Reaper's Laugh Doomsday now gives you immunity for a minute on use to protect you a bit from the wither skulls that you generate
Increased height at which diamonds generate, increased verticality of all upper y-level ores including emerald and sapphire, they now all generate up to world height so this means
the tainted spike biome will be a great place to look for these ores
Add more NPE protection to message handler for doomsday use
Fix SSP use of Doomsdays due to updated netcode
Added on more code to the 2nd iteration of the config, it'll use arrays instead of a hashmap as each blanket config needs boolean arrays and usually int arrays

1.31.1175 <148> (August 6, 2014)
Added model/render for Stin, also created a texture for it, basic entity class set up for it, I'll add on to it's ai soon, it won't have living animations yet, as with the other
entities, I'll do these all at the same time later on
Added ability for it to teleport the player away from it, a 36 block cubic area that it can possibly teleport them to, even in the air, but not inside of any blocks or other
entities, the reason this area is so small is due to how the nethandler determines if a player is cheating by moving too quickly in a tick (teleporting)
Since I can't safely override it without causing it to kick the player from the server
Modified my custom teleporter class to now check if the player has a bed they've slept in, and will teleport them to that if they are returning to the overworld
Changed Stin's teleport defense to inflict blindness on the player now when it is successful, reduced chance of it now that it has been tested
Adapted some code from the Ender Pearl to allow the player to be teleported from further away, now in a 256 * 24 rectangular area around the stin, it will only teleport you if
you don't hurt it with a projectile
Added Stin to the tragicbiome superclass, it will spawn in all of the dimension's biomes for now
Added biome localizations for the tainted biomes
Added tainted biome set ids to the config
Added Stin variants, the Stin King and Queen will be able to teleport their target a short distance if attacked (small chance), the Stin King has high armor and moves slowly but
has very high damage, the Stin Queen has a lot of health with less armor than the King but spawns in Stin Babies randomly as long as it has a target and it's in range
All of the Stin variants drops will be uncommon meaning it won't drop them every time, the King and Queen will always drop something though
Created new models for the Stin variants, the Stin baby reuses the Stin's texture but the others have their own
The Stin King and Queen are mini-bosses, they can not spawn naturally and will only spawn if a Greater Stin is corrupted
Stin can call other nearby Stin for help, the Baby and Queen have the furthest range with this

1.31.1195 <149> (August 7, 2014)
Added a passive mob, the Wisp, to the dimension, it'll attempt to avoid the player and will panic and run if hurt
It's model will be transparent, and it'll mostly be particles to see it, as such there is no texture required for it
It's particles will change based on which biome it currently is in, only for the dimensional biomes
Added Stin Horn and Wisp Particles to replace some other items in recipes, as well as to give the player a reason to kill the mobs (or try to anyway)
Fix Tungsten Jack recipe, added more recipes for the Stin Horn and Wisp Particles
Added a new item for the Abomination and Yeti, Icy Fur, it can be used to make tough leather or for extra string, it is also used in the beastly claws recipe now
Added the Abomination, reuses texture and model from previous version, updated Yeti code to utilize it
Fixed some summon code in a couple boss's ai to actual check a cubic area around them as well as summon the entity to a proper spot
Adjust the Stin's teleport defense to make sure the chosen position has available space to place the entity that is to be moved
Increase rate at which Stin Queen can spawn in babies, increase chance for it to initiate it's teleport defense
Reduced area in which Stin Queen attempts to spawn in babies, this ensures it spawns them somewhere close to it
Added textures for the new items
Make Wisps avoid Golems, this could cause them to act as a natural "distraction" for them
Try to fix issue where a mob kills it's current target but it continues to try to attack the spot where it was at
Reduce range in which Stin Queen can attempt to spawn in babies, this is to ensure it's target is close enough to cause it to do so
Added more drops for the Time Controller
Added check to make sure Babies aren't disabled for the Stin Queen's ability
Fix up Yeti's ai some more, created a new projectile for it, going to create another new projectile for a new ability, frost breath, which it'll use when it's angered and chasing
after an enemy, which is multiple projectiles in a steady stream and they cannot collide with other projectiles but if they hit an entity they damage it (similar to spirit cast)
Make it so that Abominations and Yetis are immune to the new projectiles, Cryse and MegaCryse are immune to the icicle ability now
Adding new client-side things for the Time Disruption and Time Bomb, fixed up some issues with the Time Controller using projectiles, hopefully fixed random bug where it would
insta-kill the player

1.31.1210 <150> (August 8, 2014)
Changed which mobs spawn in the dimension's biomes, I'm unsure of what mob I want to spawn in the decaying biomes, so I'll probably just have it as normal creatures like the Wisp 
and Plague which don't seek out players to attack and the Stin, the Ashen biomes now get a lot of darker mobs
For some reason I had JDK 8 installed, downgraded to JDK 7 latest update
Changed WorldHelper method again to get the best balance between speed and accuracy
Small optimizations to grass blocks
Small optimizations to spikes in worldgen to make them generate shorter (this means less overall calculations and faster load times)
Fix bug with grass block textures
Add NPE protection for the keybindings when doom or amulets are disabled
Fix the natural items from not dropping from the blocks that should drop them, this was due to me setting the rarity way too high, as such these items were basically unobtainable
Remove all aspects of the magic property from workspace, if I hadn't done this, I would've rewritten it completely regardless
Rewriting Amulet events to optimize the code and make it easier to add new effects or alter old ones
Fix bug when going from Nether to Overworld, a crash report has this but it's never happened to me, but either way the method was fixed/improved
Finished rewrite of Amulet events
Improved Time Amulet effects on EntityItems, used some code from XP Orbs to get a similar movement to when they get attracted to a player, added a random "hop" to them for the lulz
Consolidated Corruption events into the Potion Events class, removed Sampling Events
Add NPE Protection to WeaponEvents class
Add confirmation message when an amulet release, cooldown defuse or doom consume is used
Remove more extraneous item classes

1.32.1220 [Added Id Handling for Enchantments, Potions and Biomes, for improved compatibility with other mods, also added Fear and rewrote Flight] <151> (August 11, 2014)
Add Fear potion effect as I thought of using the time and time controller's effects to utilize the way I wanted the fear mechanic to work, works similarly to how the avoid entity
ai in vanilla mobs works except it doesn't set a path, it just moves the entity affected with fear in a linear direction away from other entities
Gave this effect to Death Reaper and Stin King, the Stin King automatically applies it to it's attack target, the Death Reaper has a chance to apply it when it attacks it's target
directly
Added Fear to the Doomsday Fear, slightly increased cost per wave of using Rapid Fire and Reaper's Laugh
Added a new quartz variant, these will be used for the Celestial Temple structure
Added some id handling for Enchantments, Biomes and Potions, what this will do is check if the config id is valid to register it, and if not uses the next free one, these are to
be used as the default ids for them in the config as well
If no id is available for the enchantment, biome or potion, then it'll do what normally occurs when this happens and throw an error
This Id handling was meant to avoid incompatibilities with other mods, at least assuming the open id chosen doesn't take up a slot of an uninitialized mod, but due to the filtering
of mods (alphabetical order by mod id), my mod should be initialized later than most other mods and so this shouldn't happen very often (if at all), in fact it should happen very
rarely now
This id handling will be implemented into the current config and be added into the 2nd config when that is being worked on
This required moving the potion reflection to inside of the config file as the reflection is necessary to even check my custom potion ids
Rewrote how Flight potion effect is done, it now does not use flight capabilities, however, this requires the server to have flight enabled now (which is a good thing)
Now Flight effect gets disabled if the server has flight disabled, the effect will still be in the game but have no function
It disables flight in single player as well if the client joined a server where flight was disabled, but this only requires a restart of minecraft to reset it for single player

1.32.1228 <152>
Small fixes to grass blocks and tall grass, set the right tool for them
Add effective blocks from dimension to the scythe and jack
Remove extraneous methods in the jack superclass
Made it so that if you do manage to break a summon block without the boss being summoned (by being invisible) then it'll drop a massive amount of xp for you but can not be silk
touch harvested
Rewrote how Malnourish works to effectively work on servers, it now maxes out at an amplifier of 5 instead of 10, it'll randomly add exhaustion to the player as well now, it will
refuse use of food until the player dips below a certain point on their health, at which point the player may eat to keep their hunger up to the point where they will not die
Attempting to fix an issue when lightning strikes a mob from mo creatures, I'm unsure of how this exception is actually being thrown so I'll have to do specific testing with
that mod installed to even see if this is even the issue
While I was at it, I changed the lightning strike event to spawn a lightning orb whenever it strikes an entity (25% chance) and made it that lightning creepers now drop at least
one when they get killed, up to 3
Add some NPE Protection when potions are disabled for my mobs
Reduce how long icicles stay alive after being fired from the Yeti
Fix some redundancy in projectile code

1.33.1243 [First full custom entity created, first successful use of datawatchers] <153> (August 14, 2014)
Added boss statues, these will be for the mini-bosses and normal bosses as trophy-like things
Added two datawatchers for the statue entities, these change the model and texture identifying the statue
Made it so that you only lose the item you used on them if you're not in creative mode and if the item actually changed the texture from what it previously was
Working on allowing the statue to be rotated, it works and saves it's state but it doesn't actually rotate the full 360 degrees, it only goes up to 180
Added Lightning Summoner and Explosion Generator to Creative only items, working on fixing the statue's item icons now
Fixed the statue item's icons, was using the wrong method to override
Added the mini-bosses to the statue items, will fix the rotation thing later on
Added the trophy drops to all of the bosses and mini-bosses, they will always drop on the boss's death
There seems to be some sort of memory leak with the statues, this is most likely an opengl memory leak as I have very little experience with it and can find no good tutorials
on using it online
Due to this fact, I'll remove the statues as drops from the bosses and mini-bosses and have them set in the creative tab and marked as WIP
Updated to Forge 10.13.0.1207
Simplified rendering such that the Lead Knot in Vanilla uses just a bit less than it (other than all of the switch statements for the model and texture)
Fixed a possible issue with the statue entity updating twice per tick instead of once (derp)
Made it so that the itemstack can now save what texture the mob had, this resulted in over 200 damage values for the statue item, maxing out at 209 for now until I add more
mobs to the possible list of trophies, I may remove the checkered texture if there ends up not being enough room for all of the bosses/mobs
Made it so that the statues can now properly get placed in the right spot if placed under or on the side of a block, added check to ensure they aren't placed in liquids and don't
collide with any other bounding boxes
Fix offset damage value in statue item, add localization for all of the mutations of the statues
Fix offsets in all block icons
Fix recipes for Star Crystal blocks
Add icons for all of the Statue types, these are supposed to look kinda derpy but I may change them to "cooler" looking ones in the future
Add localization for the most recently added items
Finish up for a new release, removing requirement of 1.7.10 or 1.7.2 for use, this simplifies releases and should not affect the end user's experience
Partially revert versioning requirement change, the 1.7.2 version does not load properly due to a build bug with Forge, as such I'll have to continue with another split release

1.33.1263 <154> (August 17, 2014)
Fix dynamic id handling, before the ids would override each other if they were set into a range that had no available ids, resulting in only one (the last one) actually getting
registered
Set flower sound type to proper sound
Made it that some animals spawn as babies, this adds a nice little variation to the normal animal spawns
Add luxury boss drops that drop off of the main bosses in addition to their normal drops, this is to give the player more reward for the hard work it takes to kill them
Fix derp up with Apis's fire creation trait when it's health is low
Add more common drops to Apis, including the entire light armor set
Increase chance of common drops to drop
Increase chance of Light Particles to drop off of Apis
Changed recipe for Pitch Black to use Pure Darkness which will drop off of Erebus and Nyx
Added Ash drop to Bat if it dies while on fire (which is fairly common actually)
Add statue drops to all of the mobs that have them, move them to Survival tab
Update projectile entities to utilize their superclass better, allowing them to just override the particle if change in projectile update isn't required
Learned how to summon a Lightning Bolt with it's rendering effect, had to look into vanilla code to see how it is naturally generated and use that method
Added new mob variants for the dimension, the Star Cryse, it will have it's own star-like model and each one will spawn with a different color, the Lava Pirah, which is just a
lava variant of the Pirah that spawns in the dimension (inside of lava instead of water), the Janna, a Jabba variant that is just a recolor with more health and damage but
without an anger attack, the Star-Vox, a dimension variant of the Nor-Vox, it will spawn with different colors like the star cryse but can transform (it'll retain it's color when
it transforms) into the Vox Stellarum, which will be a three headed Star-Vox that has special attacks, and the Pox, a Tox variant that is smaller and weaker but more toxic

1.33.1280 <155> (August 21, 2014)
Fix localization of the smooth netherrack blocks
Update the mob renders to reduce the amount of them, although this clutters the constructor arguments, it reduces the amount of classes that are created from it
Going to update some of the mob's animations, textures and overall aesthetics, also I'm going to do some ai fixes/adjustments as well as other things to do with the mobs
Update Tme Controller to use a datawatcher for it's time modes instead of an enum, this should improve how it looks, assuming I didn't derp something up
Remove tooltips and references to it, due to the sheer amount of mods that use keybindings, having one just for viewing my tooltips seems unnecessary and just a waste
The information that the tooltips had will hopefully be put into the wiki (assuming I actually sit down and create it and add ALL the things in it)
Changed slight rendering for the Polaris so that it'll render with a cool weird effect when it's in moonlight
Reduced damage of Spirit Cast projectile, it is very highly damaging and could basically 3 hit kill any player since it does unblockable damage and goes through walls
Made it so that clarity allows you to see things that are normally invisible, only bug is that it doesn't stop it from showing up after the effect has worn off unless it gets
set back to invisible by itself or something else, but honestly this isn't that big of a deal
Fix up some booleans and such in the NorVox AI, fix up a few things in the Minotaur AI, add the isBomb nbt tag to the Death Reaper Clone so that it remembers it if it needs to
Fix up some code in the Death Reaper's ai, specifically allowing it to summon lightning that actually gets rendered, add in a buffer time for when it can spawn in clones and
fix up some other small things, reduce it's armor when it's health is lower
Fix some code with the Jabba's anger ticks, also update code for Jarra since it basically uses the same code
Change poison barbs to projectile entities rather than throwable ones, update code in ItemProjectile to not only clean it up but change poison barb to reflect this
Fix up the two doomsdays that used the poison barbs, fix derp up in Toxicity's confirmation message
Clean up Kragul's ai some, add a wait time between shots so that it is not as deadly
Clean up Magmox's ai, clean up Tox and Pox's ai

1.34.1303 [Finish rewrite of Config, update all references to old config, start work on Gui for config] <156> (August 22, 2014)
Moved all of the Techne files for my models into their own package
Finishing up the new config currently, already have done all of the mobs, enchantments, potions, dimension, biomes, amulets, doom, working on Vanilla Changes and WorldGen right now
Some things such as Dynamic Health scaling were changed to always happen, and things like Creepers always exploding on death and random Player exhaustion were removed
Overall the amount of config options was reduced, but things that weren't implemented or aren't planned to be implemented anymore weren't added
Changed how the rarity values worked for most things, especially structure generation rarity
Another change brought on by this is the order of ids in some things such as potion effects and enchantments
Prep for changeover to new Config file, change all references in new config to the static one in the main class
Simplify armor constructor
Set up the new config for the entire mod, changed some rates and chances to utilize the way the new ones were set up, fix some redundancy in mob and doomsday code
Possibly fix bug with bosses doing their loot drops, increase amount of loot that they drop now
Make it so that Cripple now checks if the player's health is above the max and sets it to the max every tick (fixes a bug where the player would keep their "full" health while it
was active)
Simplify Statue spawning of an entity when Life Water is used on them, in the future this may just animate the statue
Clean up vanilla changing events some, remove some unused things, make some things always happen
Make most weapon abilities uphold to the new config option of whether non doomsday abilities should be allowed
Clean up enchantment and potion class
Make silverfish rate configurable, make all overworld and nether ore vein sizes and ranges non-configurable
Add star crystal rarity to config
Reduced chance of bats to spawn in the dimension, added Time Controller to all dimensional biomes assuming that natural boss spawns are enabled
Fix array length derps, fix dynamic id handling in the context of the config (derped up some offsets)
Change random taunt Strings in the Summon Blocks, changed the method in which they were chosen, added more taunts
Troubleshooting why bosses don't drop all that they are supposed to when they die
Actually updated to Forge 10.13.0.1208, there was an issue where the workspace wouldn't update to the new Forge version, I had to delete the entire workspace
and update it manually
This caused the Git repository to unsync, as a result I'll either create a new branch and merge it with the main one to override it or I'll delete the
repository and recreate it as I had a lot of unsynced changes

1.35.1341 [Added random Lore to weapons and armor and added Challenge items] <157> (August 24, 2014)
Decrease chance of structures to generate, default values were all set too high but that should fix the problem with them not generating at all due to the chances being too low
Add corruption damage config to actual event
Created random lore for each of the custom weapons, these were meant to add a bit of variety and a bit of a need to collect them, but I also decided to tie-in the lore rarities with
the Enchantments that the weapons come with, the enchantments are based explicity on lore rarities, not specific lores
Fixed bug with applying my enchantments to the items, this was due to the enchantments being initialized after the items, so when they were called in the arrays they were null
Made it so that the item's rarity depends on the lore rarity now
Fix derp up in Structure WorldGen regarding rarity
Started setup for Celestial Longbow, added Lore to other weapons/items that don't extend TragicWeapon
Fix derp in Gui regarding ItemJacks
Added lore to armor, each armor set will share Lore, but armor types have different enchantments
Added new Challenge items, these work almost entirely off of nbt tags, but there is a nice variation of challenge types and challenge goals
Fixed multiple initial bugs with Challenges, this necessitated me moving them into their own class and setting them up similarly to Doomsdays, however, now they work correctly
Created alternative reward arrays for if the difficulty wasn't that high, added boss spawn eggs to the higher difficulty rewards, added amulets to the highest difficulty reward
array tier
Added all of the localizations of the Challenges to the lang file (took FOREVER)
Added the lore and enchantment tiers to each of the armor sets
Added ability of Light Armor to extinguish the player if they are on fire
Optimized a bit of armor tick code
Adding a variable item icon for damaged armor, it'll be the same icon but the texture will be made to look a bit scruffy, broken or faded
If this looks good and isn't too difficult to implement, then I'll do the same for the weapons
Messed with the option of adding variable tetures for items (aesthetic variation), but it seems like a lot of extra work creating multiple textures for each item that uses it
so I'll maybe scrap it until later on when I have not as much stuff to do on the mod
I will be implementing the "damaged" weapon textures though as this is just 1 texture and will only be for weapons and armor
Reduced polling of some of the events that used the on update method, to reduce overall lag

1.35.1363 <158> (August 28, 2014)
Move Gui into the client package, move KeyInputEvent registration into the ClientProxy
Augment message confirmation for flight potion effect to be more clear
Started work on Vox Stellarum, it'll seek out mobs to kill like the Wither
For now it'll use the Star-Vox's texture and the Nor-Vox's model, I'm also going to add a spin attack and a recovery "shield" type thing
Fix NPE with Armor enchantments (same one that previously affected Weapon Enchantments)
Moved textureRes String into TragicItems class, it is still set by the config
Working on the spinning attack that the Vox Stellarum should have, currently having a problem with making it spin faster the longer it is spinning
Added "damaged" armor textures
Fix derp up with Doom config option
Fix derps with DarkArmors enchantments
Apply overall amulet rarity to each amulet
Made it so that Dark Armor now prevents you from having the Fear potion effect
Added SkullArmor's damaged textures (derp)
Make it so that if a mob is wearing one of the armors or weapons, it doesn't give it a lore until the player picks it up
Added heal spam ability to the Vox Stellarum, it doesn't move while this occurs and has a render effect applied to it as well, it also does not attack
This should be the last of the work I do on the Vox Stellarum's ai, but I still need a model for it
The model will be like 4 Star-Vox's combined into one (like a 4 faced head), each "face" will have a different expression, if it is firing it'll use the "angry" face, if
it is being hurt it'll use the "sad" face, if it is healing it'll use the "happy" face, otherwise it'll use the normal one
Added Vox Stellarum to Starlit Biomes, with the same spawn chance as other mini-bosses
Added Enyvil to the config and the dark altar's rarity
Added Darkened Quartz recipes, it uses raw nether quartz and dark particles for the base darkened quartz, the others use different amounts of darkened quartz
Fix inverted methods on EntityDropHelper, updated arrays in Helper to use nested arrays
Fix mob/boss drops from not occurring after the initial drop
Change statues to have a max stack size of 1
Remember to make the statues animated in the future and make it that if you click them with an awakening stone it animates them regardless of their current texture

1.35.1389 <159> (August 30, 2014)
Enabled transformation of the Star-Vox into the Vox Stellarum, it should maintain it's texture color when it transforms
Fix problem with Challenges not giving a reward every time they are completed, same problem that the mob drops faced
Updated Nor-Vox and Star-Vox's texture to be more... "textured" this gives them a rougher apperance
Updated Yeti and Abomination's texture, to make them seem less "polka-dot"-y
Updated Kitsune texture to give it make it have less contrast and be more "textured"
Updated Minotaur's texture to also give it a more "textured" look
Added Vox Stellarum mob statue texture
Update Spherical helper method, it now makes more accurate spheres (at the cost of more cpu again)
Remove honey and utilize other items in the recipes that used it, magma cream and thorns
Reduce drop chance of Spore
Reimplemented the Hornet Amulet, changed it to the Piercing Amulet and made it require Thorns to craft, it inflicts ap damage to whatever you attack, but it makes you take
over twice as much damage from magic
Add Frozen Lightning, a new craftable weapon that uses ice orbs and lightning orbs, it has a simple influence doomsday, Freeze, that inflicts slowness and stops all motion of
nearby entities, it also may inflict stun if crucial moment is applied, on right-click it can shoot icicles, on sneak-right-click it can summon multiple lightning strikes and
a small explosion
Update the sphere generator to print out the right block unlocalized name when a sphere is created 
Add the Frozen Lightning recipe, uses Ice Orbs and Lightning Orbs, as well as Icy Fur
Reimplemented Rune Break and Rune Walker, rune break now increases magic damage that you inflict, and rune walker now decreases magic damage that you take
Pitch Black and Frozen Lightning now have Rune Break as part of their enchantment tiers, Light Armor now has Rune Walker as part of it's enchantment tiers
For now, revert addition of the persistant Doomsday thread
Added Ice Amulet, reduces damage you take in cold biomes and inflicts slowness on anything that hits you (higher amulet levels)
Added Snow Golem Amulet, makes mob track you from further away
Added Iron Golem Amulet, gives you resistance and prevents you from taking fall damage
Added Enderman Amulet, allows you to silk touch blocks with your bare hand, but you don't mine any faster and you can only silk touch blocks that could normally be silk touched
Added Wither Amulet, you heal from wither instead of taking damage
Update Apis Temple's schematic to use more loops to optimize the code
Created Celestial Temple using the Apis Temple's schematic and switching out the blocks, the Celestial Temple should also generate a sort of "island" underneath it
Fix NPE with Darkened Quartz, with particular metadata values
Added the new set of Amulets to the chest hooks
Added Challenge scrolls to chest hooks, these will only be added if the item is enabled

1.35.1416 <160> (September 1, 2014 [Happy birthday to me...])
Add config option to disable mob statues, add configurable drop chance, default is 100(%)
Added an actual image for the Amulet Gui, the tentacle one
Made it so that you can configure whether the Doom gui is animated or not (some ppl might be finicky about this)
Added an Amulet Status gui that goes under the Doom gui, it basically just displays the Amulets that the player currently has active, it also shows how many slots they have
unlocked, it is a very minimalistic gui, it also displays how much durability the amulets have left
Remove console spam from mob drops
Added Vox Stellarum model
Fixed some renders that used transparency and other effects
Increase the Kitsune's hitbox a bit, change the Vox Stellarum's hitbox to match it's model better
Updated Darkened Quartz texture to be darker and unsaturated
The Celestial Temple now also generates a bunch of smaller islands around it to give the island a different shape every time it is generated
Added wood recipes to convert raw wood into planks (dimension wood types)
Changed Harmony Bell recipe to use Kitsune Tails, updated texture to reflect this
Added a bunch of recipes using the boss drops as components, these are to give them more use (though they won't be used like that very much, I'd assume)
Changed Statue rebirth item to Living Clay instead of Life Water
Added 2 more amulet gui skins, a pink ender styled one and a tragic neko styled one
Added matching amulet status skins, these are all set by the same config option, added small gui change to show that a slot is locked that can be unlocked
I'll add skins for the doom gui as well, which will be updated to match it, though this would mean the option would move to the misc category due to it being for the amulet
gui and the doom gui
Make it so that the Vox Stellarum doesn't attempt to turn and face things while it is spinning (this messes up the rotation)
Fix inverted parameters in amulet status gui
Make it so that every use of the Dimensional Key damages it
Make it so that any non-creative mode use of the Sword/Bow of Justice immediately breaks it after use (I may slip these into chests and boss drops as super high damage one hit
weapons, but they won't be effective against bosses)
Add the Celestial Aegis and Celestial Longbow, the Celestial Aegis will reduce all incoming damage by a flat percentage while it's in the player's hand
Changed all weapon non doomsday abilities that deter damage to make sure the player isn't in creative mode, also reduced doom cost of some of them
Added ability for the Withering Axe to inflict Wither on whatever you attack with it (I thought it already had it, woops)
Added Celestial Aegis's doomsday, Moonlight Sonata, it can only be used on or around midnight in a normal minecraft day and only when the player is on the surface, it'll
completely refill the player's doom with high cooldown
Added textures for the Celestial Longbow (all phases of it) and added the Celestial Steel item to make crafting of the Celestial weapons more difficult, due to this their
proposed enchantments were buffed and their durability was increased
Changed Celestial longbow's teleportation to utilize the same thing that the ender pearl does to ensure of secure player transport
Looking at the amount of items and armors, I will not reimplement the Draconic Armor and the Dragon Fang's Doomsday will be a combined doomsday of the proposed one for the
Armor with it's own proposed one
In accordance with making the Celestial weapons stronger due to the difficulty of crafting them, the Celestial Aegis will have 2 doomsdays, the first and probably only weapon
to, the 2nd Doomsday is the Flight of the Valkyries, it tosses mobs up into the air and inflicts random damage to them over the duration of the doomsday, healing you as well
and striking the ground with lightning randomly for a cool effect

1.35.1416++ <161> (September 4, 2014)
Rewrote the Flight Potion Effect again, now it takes effect as long as you hold down the space-bar, and you can ascend faster if you get a sprinting head-start
I also expanded the time the safeguard has, it attempts to move you closer to the ground quickly so that you don't take as much damage when it wears off
Added potion icons now for when you look in your inventory, this helps to easily identify the effects you have on you
Added new field for threaded doomsdays if they update every tick (only some will use this, mostly the Ultimate ones)
Working on the "Epic" weapons doomsdays, then I'll work on their non-Doomsday abilities
Added Titanfall Doomsday, for the Titan, it's a bit finicky on whether it crashes the server or not
Added the non-Doomsday ability for the Pitch Black, which throws it, and if it hits a living entity it teleports back to your hand, but if you miss, it drops where it hit
Added the non-Doomsday ability of the Titan, it creates an explosion and strikes whatever you attack with it with lightning strikes, another ability creates a long line of
lightning strikes in the direction that you're looking, further distance increases the amount of strikes
The Titan can also fully heal you if you get struck by lightning, but only if you have enough Doom (requires 30)
It will not have Lore or enchantment tiers set up until I finish all of the epic weapon's abilities and doomsdays
Added alternative textures for the Doom bar gui, it will now match the amulet gui skins
Shifting position of the gui to take up as little room as possible
Changing check for if the doomsdays are able to be used in the gui, specializing it for the Celestial Aegis as it is a special case
Fix "ghost" potion effects given by poison barb entities
Fix Doom command string outputs, they now also say the player's doom that was changed and properly check to ensure that the input value was an integer
Added pokemon themed gui skins, because the amulet status modules looked like pokeballs to me (I'm such a nerd)
Added Bloodlust Doomsday for the Butcher, added Permafrost Doomsday for the Thardus
Added textures for the Butcher and Dragon Fang
Added a method in the TragicWeapon superclass to reduce code redundancy, dealing with getting the MovingObjectPosition from the player
Changed Boss spawns so that they do not spawn below y = 63 now if they aren't in my dimension or the nether

1.36.1440 [Rewrite of Threaded Doomsdays to avoid Concurrency issues, addition of Combination Doomsdays] <162> (September 5, 2014)
Added a DoomsdayManager, this allows for players to use multiple doomsdays concurrently (hopefully) through a single integrated tick handler, which then updates each doomsday
after a certain amount of time, this deprecates the DoomThread, which was instantiated local threads which worked independently of each other and were hard to keep in sync
with the main game loop causing many ConcurrentModificationExceptions
The Doomsday Manager requires the use of DoomsdayEffect, a new type which works similarly to PotionEffect, that allows for instanced use of Doomsdays, the Manager will be
responsible for ensuring that each player is kept updated with their proper doomsdays and that each active doomsday effect is activated at the proper times
Rewriting most Doomsdays to fit in with the new DoomsdayEffects, this means that if you use a Doomsday that attacks mobs in a list, it won't cancel it before it's activated,
instead it'll apply the full cost and doom, so this means you can't just spam it until you hit something, you need to aim it if you want to use it efficiently
Each Doomsday class was majorly simplified due to this
Added method in Doomsday class to get MovingObjectPosition from player
Also reimplementing the Backlash effects for doomsdays
Retooled the Doomsday, Flight of the Valkyries to be a combination Doomsday of the Celestial Aegis's Doomsdays, Moonlight Sonata and Purge, which is a new Doomsday that inflicts
damage on mobs that are near the player during it's duration
The Combination Doomsdays are expensive but are really good, however, their effects and doomsday combinations are going to be "secret"
Added Lightning Rush Doomsday, which is a Combination Doomsday of the Titan's Titanfall doomsday and the Mourning Star's Ravage Doomsday
Fixed issue with Doom not being saved between deaths
Now that I finished rewriting the Doomsdays, I can work on the other Epic weapon Doomsdays and also can work on new Combination Doomsdays
Weather and Time items are being rebranded as Talismans
Fix bug where you could have two extended Doomsdays of the same type for a Combination Doomsday to use it
Converted Nature Drain into an extended Doomsday, combined with Reality Alter changes it into Growth Spurt
Fix NPE with meta values on placing double tall plants during the Growth Spurt Doomsday
Added another Combination Doomsday, Blizzard, combining Permafrost and Freeze, it creates a wave of Icicles around the user that stops most things from even getting near you
Added Asphyxiate Doomsday, it works pretty much how I wanted (though I thought it'd look cooler), added non-Doomsday abilities to the Splinter and Paranoia
Added non-Doomsday abilities to the Butcher, though they don't work so I removed them, kept the super high knockback hit though
Added Dragon Fang's two Doomsdays, it is the only other weapon thus far with two doomsdays, and it will also have a combination doomsday (just like the Celestial Aegis)
Added non-Doomsday abilities for the Dragon Fang, specifically a "flamethrower"
Added recipes for all of the Talisman items
Added the epic weapons to chest hooks, challenge item rewards (highest tier), and as random luxury boss drops
Reduced limit of luxury boss drops, they should drop less of them now on death
Fix possible bug with bosses dying when mob looting is disabled

1.36.1454 <163> (September 7, 2014)
Added Doomsday Scrolls, these will allow you to use any of the doomsdays in the mod, including combination doomsdays and ones that don't even have a weapon assigned to them
like Paradigm Shift, Lateralus and Death Mark, these can only be found in chests and off of bosses
Added Blood/Nourishment Sacrifice, these allow an alternative method to regain doom (if you can't find any Doom Consumes)
Added the Sacrifices to the chest hooks, added Doomsday Scrolls to the chest hooks as well
Added a Sky Fruit that gives you Flight when eaten, recovers a decent amount of hunger as well
Made it so that my leaf blocks now change based on whether fancy graphics are enabled or not (they don't change light opacity or which sides get rendered but it should be fine)
Add knockback resistance buff to the player when they have the Butcher in their hand, as long as they have at least 1 Doom
Reduced health of Kragul to 8, in Hard, this means 2 less hits to kill, in Normal/Easy it is 1 less hit to kill, also fixed a bug with it's attack where it would hit twice in
one attack
Converted Mindcrack into an extended Doomsday in order to persist removing surrounding entities's motion
Added Shotgun and Firestorm combination Doomsdays
Fixed initial bug with Shotgun Doomsday
Fix some potion effect bugs with projectiles, rewrote Pumpkinbomb projectile's physics
Deny a Doomsday effect if the player already has an effect of the same Doomsday registered, also remove extraneous array method as any effect registrations are going to
be singular
Add a method to remove a player from the registrations, this will be used if the player disconnects or leaves a server in the middle of an effect
Added a reason why the player was removed from registrations, this is just for clarification

1.36.1471 <164> (September 10, 2014)
Started working on the Enyvil, set it up using parts similar to the Ender Dragon, it currently attacks with it's claws to do a huge amount of damage, it takes full damage when
it gets hit in the eye, but otherwise takes 1/6th of the damage, it is also immune to fall damage and all potion effects
While setting it up, I set up the ability to make multipart entities, due to this some other bosses may be reworked a bit to utilize this
Renamed the Kitsune to Kitsunakuma (minor name change but it makes it feel more unique, plus ppl could still call it Kitsune anyway), renamed the Death Reaper to Skultar as it
is a more unique sounding name and it invokes the image of a skull, which is it's defining feature (in my opinion), renamed the Yeti to Empariah, Pariah is a social outcast of
sorts which goes with it's underlings being named Abominations, Emperor Pariah, so it'll be given a crown and I'll also add sharp claws and a few other features to it to make
it feel more unique
The Enyvil has multiple attacks currently, it'll smash enemies with it's claws for major damage, it can shoot a dark lightning burst out of it's eye, it can create random
explosive lightning around it, it can suck enemies into it to get hit by it's claw, it can use a dark energy wave attack and it can fire a laser from a dark crystal to hurt
it's target
Ensure that the player cannot attack or use items while they are Feared, they also cannot use Doomsdays
Made it so that the Dark Crystal now follows the Enyvil around, as well as making it sorta "hover" in the air, it uses a placeholder render currently but it'll be changed when
the Enyvil's AI is finished up and it's texture is added
Set up ToolMaterial for the Sentinel, it'll be the strongest survival weapon in the mod (for now)
Slightly changed Enyvil so that if it gets hit in the eye while using it's tractor beam, it'll stop (25% chance), and it also stops if it hurts the player in that phase, otherwise
it continues it's current phase unabated
Added Enyvil's texture, looks pretty cool in my opinion
Added tiled textures for the Statue, some of these look good and others look a bit noisy but they should be fine
Fixed a bug with Enyvil's ai, made it's common ai more common, made it so that on spawn it creates dark crystals so that it doesn't start out in state 4 (unable to attack and
sitting still like it has no ai)
Fixed another bug that never reset it's state even if it had crystals nearby, fixed it's tractor beam attack, will make it move all of the dark crystals along with it in the
nearby area
Added the next passive mob, the Erkel, a small mushroom-like fungus that mostly keeps to itself, it's texture will change based on where it spawns, it poisons whatever hurts it
Changed creative tab icon to be the Neko Neko Wand (even though it doesn't work correctly), updated a couple of the spawn egg colors
Removed logger spam from Enyvil, made it so that it will not spawn anymore Dark Crystals if there is at least 5 around it
Updated the last batch of Amulet's texture colors
Fix localization of Piercing Amulet

1.36.1499 <165> (September 17, 2014)
Added new network message and handler to deal with extended weapon range, this is due to the fact that vanilla always does a hardcoded check for distance to entity before the
entity is actually attacked, so I have to get entities within the player's look vectors and attack them manually (it always hits the closest entity within the vector)
Fixed potentional issue where the weapon range would hit entities within the normal vanilla range was well as an entity behind it, this could be good for piercing weapons but
for just extended reach it isn't exactly what I want
Added Reach and Unbreakable enchantments, fixed some initial bugs with both
The Epic weapons will have Reach III on all enchantment tiers, but a couple like the Butcher will have Reach V on the highest tier
Added Reach to the epic enchantment tier of the Celestial Aegis
Updated enchantment tiers for the epic weapons, going to work on lore next
Updated all references to the main class's logger to use the static methods instead of directly invoking the logger
Added null checks to entity drops, this is to prevent a crash if something was messed up, instead it logs an error
Set up a Forge event to ensure bosses only spawn alone (maximum pack size of 1 so that it doesn't spawn multiple naturally), also added in a default 10% chance for bosses to spawn
Added Rust Enchantment, does extra durability damage to an enemy's armor when attacking them
Started work on the Claymation, it's ai will be quite complex as it actually changes between multiple other mob ai and also takes their stats
Made it so that Claymation is immune to all projectile damage (while in it's original form) except for snowballs and icicles
Decided to make the Claymation also do the entity that it's replicating's response to being attacked and to attacking (if they normally inflict effects then it does those)
It also does the Ragr's fall explosion thing as well as the Iron golem's animation when it attacks (which can be set up for other forms as well)
I just have to finish up the Claymation's actual model and set it's hit box, then do a lot of testing to ensure the ai works correctly
Made it so that it doesn't revert back to it's normal form immediately when it's attack target dies, and also doesn't heal immediately when that occurs as well, set up the nbt
tags for it so that it doesn't return to full health every time
Working on making it's boundingbox adjust for each entity that it turns into but this doesn't seem possible as it's a final field, so I'll probably need to use reflection in
order to set it specifically for the Claymation
Attempts to use reflection haven't done anything in terms of changing the Claymation's bounding box, so I'll just ignore it for now
Made it so that Erkel now spawn mushrooms wherever they go, started work on the Sirv's AI which will be very basic, it'll use a hive mind type of AI
Added some more null checks to the entity drop helper
Added drops for the Erkel and Claymation
Added statue recipes utilizing Living Clay
Added the Sirv and it's drops, along with it's model and set up it's hitbox
Added the Sirv and Erkel to the Dimension's spawn lists
Optimized Dimensional layer world gen by removing a lot of for loops
Fix NPE with Stin and Baby Stin's drops
Greatly improved WorldGen for the Dimension, mostly with the layers and void pit generation
Increased Inkling's resistance to light so that it burns in less areas

1.36.1520 <166> (September 20, 2014)
Decreased overall chance for void pits to generate, reduced their average and max size
Fixed issue with LayerGen, where it would stall the world load because the paloma was set too high
Added LICENSE, this was here before but when I had to redo the Github it didn't transfer over, it is now a part of the mod
Moved the README and changed the Changelog, README and LICENSE file formats to .txt
Added Erkel model and texture, set it's hitbox
Added the Dark Crystal's model and render, added a particle effect to it
Removed some logger spam from the initialization events
Removed change of Flight Potion effect boolean if the server has flight allowed but you don't, this would set your flight effect always active regardless of your config option
Added Claymation original form model, it's hitbox will stay the same throughout all of it's forms, as such I'll remove the size change attempt when it changes forms
Updated Empariah's model, slightly modified it's hitbox and texture to adjust for it
Added Large Rock model for the Empariah's Large Rock
Fix up Large Rock entity a bit, fix removal of Icicle after a certain amount of ticks
Made it that my Bosses can now change targets if they get hit by a living entity, previously they would remain attached to their initial target regardless of what was hitting
them
Did a bit of experimentation with rendering weapon models, this will be done next update
Added Lore for the Epic weapons
Final tests before releases, another split release as the two versions seem to be getting nearly the same amount of downloads
Fix Butcher's Lore
Fix Combustion, it wasn't working on all the blocks it should've
Set baby animal spawns default to false
Reduce Minotaur and Inkling's speed when moving towards their attack target
Fix up joining a server, it was a client-side crash caused by me fixing a server-side issue with loading the Clarity potion effect
Update version numbers

1.37.1542 [Mob superclass rewrites, rewriting every mob's AI to fix things and make them better, set up their animations, fix up their models] <167> (September 22, 2014)
Moved giant weapon render to the normal render package alongside the Statue and various projectile renders, it didn't need it's own package
Adjust internal ordering of Enchantments to keep consistant with the Config
Fix localization of Apis Amulet
Made it that dynamic Id handling for potions, biomes and enchantments no longer crashes if the id range is set too high, it now loops back to the start of the array until it
finds an open id, I was trying to avoid doing this for some reason, but either way it should be completely dynamic now, the only problem is other mods trying to set their ids
after these are set
Fix derp in Erkel's block drops
Allow people to visually know the difference between Cursed and Epic amulets, they will use the same texture as Cursed amulets but with white chains instead of black
Set all color codes to use the hex values instead of using a color, then getting the rgb value from that, bit of optimization and cleaning up of code
Starting on the mob AI rewrites, adding mob animations and such as I go, improving their models as well
Fixed up Abomination's AI, it has similar animations to the Iron Golem
Decreased the damage it takes from fire, made it resistant to all weapons other than swords instead of making swords do additional damage to it, also slightly increased it's
armor amount
Made it that it now "celebrates" for a bit after killing something, it jumps up and down and swings it's arms, all of the ones around it celebrate as well
Also added a strength and resistance buff to my mobs when they kill another living entity
Changed the MiniBoss class into a marker interface as it didn't have much use otherwise, changed a lot of things in the TragicMob class that greatly simplified it, added a quick
datawatcher to keep track of corruption ticks, added a couple of methods to make it easier to determine if a mob should change (if it has a form to change into) and if it should
attack a specific class
Combined the Jarra and Janna classes into one, this makes specifying them harder (like to summon them), but makes dealing with AI changes way easier
Added basic mob animations to the Jabba/Janna, modified it's model to utilize the child parts, it now moves it's pincers randomly and will move them while attacking or taking
damage
Jarra extends EntityJabba now, it modifies behaviors of this to use the poison effects of the Janna with the anger abilities of the Jabba, the spikes on it now "wiggle" when it's
angry, it also gains a particle effect
Simplified Plague AI, change it's motion to be more "twitchy" rather than just erratic and random, reduced the amount of particles it does
Reduced Plague health and cut life span in half
Removed particle effects from Gragul/Kragul, made Kragul extend EntityGragul, lowered their y-offset with their model, added small animations (literally small animations to the
tiny feet and arms on them) and increased amount of Spirit Bursts that the Kragul fires, but add a buffer period during which it can fire them
The Gragul is now more difficult to see and way more deadlier, however, the damage resistant time for both was reduced making them easier to kill as well
Reduced hitbox of Spirit Burst to better fit it's render
Cleaned up Minotaur's AI some, made it charge more efficiently and it can now attempt to charge at entities above it (it doesn't shoot up into the air though), it now takes less
damage while it's charging and has sprint particles underneath it, it also has a stance for when it's charging now

1.37.1562 <168> (September 26, 2014)
Clean up Inkling's AI, completely remove it's ability to summon help, make it's range checks more efficient, make it more difficult to see while invisible but reduce it's health
Increased range at which Inkling can teleport, made it handle being on fire better, it can now break torches at farther range and now also spawns in the EntityItem so that it's
not gone forever once it's broken
Added basic animations for it, you won't even get to see them due to the Inkling being invisible most of the time, but added regardless
Fixed some problems with the Ragr (target acquisition, miscalculations on fall height to explosion size, etc.), improve it's block crushing ability, reduce the lag it creates
on update, now I can have around 10 of them and only lose about 10 frames (compared to around 30 previously)
Add some cool animations for it when it jumps around and when it's on the ground, it looks really good I was thinking of creating a Ragr pit structure just because of this
Rewrote most of the Pumpkinhead's AI, it now sets it's home pumpkin faster and applies effects faster while it has one, it now has an animation when it gets angry and has a
home pumpkin, it is a lot more dangerous to attack now, reduced it's health to balance this
Added NBT Tags for most of the mobs that have been rewritten to this point
Rewrote most of the Tragic Neko's AI, it now goes through it's firing pattern more efficiently, and has animations for each aspect of it's attacks, it will fire a missle once
in a while and throw bombs at other times, it can also run up and smack it's target with it's weapon, this was given an increased damage to compensate for it firing less missles
Updating the Tox's AI, combining the Pox's class with it (like the Jabba) and increasing the amount of projectiles it fires but reducing it's normal hit damage when something is
near it
Fixed up other things with the Tox, added a lot of animation stuff to it, it fluffs off particles when it wiggles it's head or when it gets hit, or while it's attacking
Updated the Cryse's AI, it has a very basic AI so I just added a few animations to it while it's idle
Updated the Mega Cryse's AI and model, it now actually renders shields to match how many it has
Fixed some NPEs with the mob statues and Claymation while trying to render the models that now have animations, fixed offsets with Mega Cryse for the statue
Updated the Jabba/Jarra model animations to add a normal movement one (it wiggles it's body like a snake now)
Combined the Star-Vox and Nor-Vox classes (as per previous mobs), updated the Nor-Vox AI to be more efficient, lowered the health of the Star-Vox but increased it's armor amount
Added Star Crystal as drops for the Cryse and Nor-Vox, these are for the variants, but it isn't that big of a deal (I can override the onDeath method later to do this)
Added an idle "nod" animation to the Nor-Vox, also added a "teeth chatter" animation for all of it's animations, these will be copied for the Vox Stellarum which has it's
spinning attack animation done in it's model rather than render now
Modified the change method for boss trasformations to copy the nbt data for mobs that have a textureID value
Simplified the "find entity while corrupted" thing for my mobs, it should now work more effectively
Fixed the Mob Transformation and the Corruption damage booleans in the config, I apparently never set these, derp

1.37.1573 <169> (October 1, 2014)
Setting up corruption currently, it checks for entities within 16 blocks and if there are no entities, then it increments the healing ticks, else it resets them to 0
It'll corrupt any mobs within 4 blocks that it can see
Allow Doomsday manager to also remove any mappings for Doom and Amulet properties in the CommonProxy storage
On entity death, do a check to ensure that the entity was not in the mappings, otherwise clear it from it
Made it that entities can now be healed with Nasty Fruit and/or Golden Sushi, they will remove the Corruption effect as well as give them all the buffs they would've gotten if they
had eaten them like a player, this allows players to save corrupted pets and animals
Fix Pirah's drops, it was doing the drop chance twice meaning it could drop twice as much as intended
Fix up Pirah's AI and movements, it's always been a bit buggy and unnatural so I thought I'd fix it up some and add some animations to liven it up
It moves a bit more naturally (though a bit more erratic than I would like), but otherwise it moves well, got the Lava Pirah to move about the same in lava, made a golden pirah
variant based on it's texture id, it'll be slightly larger than the normal variants and be gold, it'll have twice the health and attack damage
Added a Luminescence block, a transparent block that emits light, it disappears after a few seconds from being placed, it'll be used to give some of my entities luminescence and
will also be used for a tool enchantment to light up where the player is at while mining with the tool in their hand
After some experimentation, it'll be placed randomly per tick around the entity, and will only replace air and itself to avoid any sort of mob griefing, this will be added on
to further entities but for now I'll finish updating the mob AIs and models
Stop the game from crashing when the dimension was previously loaded with an older version of the mod, this was meant to crash if something went wrong with the biomes while I
was setting the Dimension up, but now it's causing crashes when updating worlds to a newer version
Remove logger spam from this change, the world will now load up fine if the Dimension was loaded previously, however, the blocks may be misplaced and may require a Dimension
restart (deleting the Dimension folder in the world save) to regenerate it normally, this is better than it not allowing ppl to update though

1.37.1590 <170>  (October 4, 2014)
Fix up the statue rendering and entity datawatchers, this increases the efficiency of their entity updating, it now updates immediately instead of showing the Apis model then
changing to the proper one, it also now has a variant when a Celestial Diamond is used on it that gives it constant rotation
Fix the OpenGL memory leaks that the statues suffered from, there's probably a lot of extraneous OpenGL functions in it's render, but since it's fixed I won't mess with it since
I have such little experience with it
Applied the same fixes to the other renders that utilized similar methods, the Large Rock and the Dark Crystal, that would explain why the Enyvil was so laggy
Did some testing to see what was causing entity tracking errors, it was due to me calling the onSpawnWithEgg() method before actually spawning the entity in
Updated the Stin AI, combining the Baby Stin with it, the Baby Stin will be able to climb up walls and such and will eventually grow up into the Stin, it'll then be able to
transform into a Greater Stin, which can then transform into a Stin King or Stin Queen, the Stin King and Queen will get some new attacks and such as they are pretty plain as
they currently are
The Stin has one idle animation that doubles as it's hurt animation, a galloping animation that looks pretty nice, all of the Stin variants (other than the baby) will use it
Updated to Forge 10.13.1.1219
Reduce changes done per render tick for statue rendering, don't change model unless it needs to, make it that if you "kill" the statue in creative mode, it won't drop the statue
Added the basic animations and gallop animation to the Greater Stin
Fix NPE with Greater Stin's common drops
Make the Sword of Justice have Reach V by default
Added a "Charge" attack to the Greater Stin, if it collides with a wall while charging it'll create an explosion
Added the "Dark Mortor" attack to the Stin King, it also retains the charge attack from the Greater Stin
The Stin Queen gains a "Web shot" attack that shoots a cobweb at it's target, attempting to trap it, it'll also spawn webs when it gets attacked and when it teleports it's
target away
Fixed NPE with the Reach enchantment, when used on an entity that is dead/dying, so that by the time the message is received by the server, the entity is no longer alive and
as such has no id
Modified the Dimension's WorldGen some, this just changes vanilla features such as lava lakes and mob dungeons in the Dimension, removed some extraneous Forge events that were
in the ChunkProvider, these aren't really necessary for my custom dimension
Modified the WorldHelper sphere and circle methods to use an ArrayList instead of a HashMap, this should optimize all WorldGen that utilizes it, Dimension loading times again
improved due to this, but still quite laggy for some reason

1.37.1603 <171> (October 6, 2014)
Updated the model for the Stin King, still need to adjust the offsets and add the animations, then do the same for the Stin Queen
Got the NekoNekoWand working, it now adds an entity target task to attack nearby mobs of the selected entity's class, which won't really work for entities of the same class or
entities that use the old ai system but yeah, I believe this is how the chocolate quest mob eggs worked anyway
Finished updating the models and animations for the Stin King and Queen, updated the model for the Erkel
Updated the Sirv model, added basic movement animations, updated it's AI to be pretty much empty, reduced it's move speed
Updated all of the projectile entities, going to update all of the creative items for them as well
Fix ConcurrentModification due to removal of poison potion effects on Enderman and Witches, in large groups this would occur, as a fix, I'm going to make them immune to all normal
magic damage instead
Added idle particle effects to the Wisp, including a "flare" effect and a "cough" effect
Reduce some logger spam from the mod, only log errors and warnings now, structures still have some logger spam as I plan to rewrite them
Change Splinter's random directional knockback ability to the weapon events like the butcher as onleftclickentity is called before the entity's motion is altered for the attack
so it overrides any changes done in that method in regards to entity motion
Change weird requirement of Moonlight Sonata to be used near midnight (in game time), it wasn't very reliable and was difficult to tell when it could be used, so it'll be able
to be used at nighttime and if the player is on the surface
Fix NPE with NekoNekoWand, when you register an entity that is dead and don't reset the entity for the wand, add color coding to the targetted and targetting entities as well
as cleaned up the chat message to just display the entity type rather than it's full name (no position and such)
Fix up Asphyxiate, it now teleports the mobs on initial use and otherwise freezes their motion
Fixed up Flight of the Valkyries it now moves enemies in random directions while making them hover higher and higher

1.38.1633 [Starting work on Boss animations/AI rewrites after finishing all of the normal mob ones, opitimize the Dimension again] <172> (October 8, 2014)
Updated Apis AI, utilizing the charge ticks from the Minotaur, and applying it's render effect to a new reflection ability, it also will now stomp the ground in order to do it's
close range explosive attack, which means it'll have a bit of a delay for when it actually does it, giving the player enough time to move away from it somewhat to reduce the
damage from it
Finish up the animations for the Apis, apply a particle effect for when it's about to stomp to give the player even more notification that it's about to stomp the ground
Make Apis immune to fall damage (like the other bosses), apply particle effects while it is charging and stomping
Increase the explosion size and damage done when it stomps, it should be a fatal (or at least close) if you're standing right next to it when it does it
Fix NPEs with Challenge Scroll if an attempt is made to get one that does not have a challenge (using /give to give a scroll that doesn't have a challenge set up)
Add attack and more movement animations to the Sirv, basic animations still but better than none
Added "the Worm" idle animation to the Jabba
Updated the Skultar (aka Death Reaper)'s AI, made it's demeanor give more weight to player attacks, added multiple animations and adjusted it's model and texture, it now turns
red when it's angry (as a 100% positive sign that everyone knows it's angry) and emits redstone particles
It now has less armor when it's not being aggressive, fixed it's clone spawning, lowered chance of clones being spawned in
Updated Kitsune AI, it now taunts the player randomly in between shooting fireballs and it's teleporting has been fixed (it was checking the light values before, which isn't
necessary since it doesn't take damage from anything but fireballs)
Fixed leg offset with Apis after it does it's stomping animation
Created a new model for the Kitsunakuma, to better match with the other models as well as give it a more mischievous look, it also got a new texture that uses nearly the same
colors the previous one did, but with better blending
Improved Death Reaper's Reaper Slash, it now hits all entities close to it with the attack, reduced damage when attacking players to try and avoid instakills
Made the Polaris and Claymation's textures animated
Finished up the Kitsunakuma's new texture and animations, added an attack time, switched it's normal attack to a "double swipe" attack, which will rarely actually double hit it's
target, but it has that chance
Lowered it's attack damage but improved it's ability to handle close quarters combat, increased range it's double swipe can hit
Added a safeguard for bosses that use a lot of fire abilities (causing a lot of fires to be created by them) to extinguish all of the fires within a certain radius when they die
to avoid the drops from going into nearby fire and getting destroyed, lava is something that the player should account for so it is not going to be dealt with here
Reduce overall chance of luxury drops from bosses, they were dropping a bit too much
Integrated Death Reaper clone into the Death Reaper's class, it'll use all of the same abilities but take 10x the damage, with reduced armor as well
Added more of the bosses to the natural spawns in the overworld, this is in case ppl dont want to use the Dimension for whatever reason, they can still "complete" the mod
Revert change to stop statue from dropping when destroyed by a creative mode player, they now uphold to the mob loot gamerule as well
Reduce lighting in the Dimension (reduce amount of blocks that emit light), hopefully to improve load times and overall stability (had some effect but it still hangs randomly)
Reduce average size of void pits in the Dimension (again), to reduce the lag spikes those create
Added Wisp and Erkel to the overworld, they spawn in forest biomes, the Wisp may also spawn in deserts and mesas
Fix some things with potion effects, Immunity now overrides Inhibit, Saturation overrides Malnourish, Health Boost overrides Cripple
Remove Balloon tree generation, it is extremely laggy and isn't worth it aesthetically, therefore I'll possibly modify the vanilla tree gen in order to do what I want at a 
later date
Change my leaf blocks to update once the player does a mouse input to match the game setting, this requires the block to be updated (client-side) in order to show a change though
The largest improvement for the dimension was reducing the amount of attempts the Dimension layers had to generate, from 256 * 3 down to 48 * 3 per chunk, with both of those
* 10, again, I didn't realize this when I did it but that is 7680 blocks checked per chunk, with a render distance of 10 that is easily 768000 blocks checked each time you load
up a new area, now it is down to 144000, less than 20% of that amount, with even less since it now does a check before checking all the blocks to ensure that it even can gen
blocks in that y-range, reducing about 10% more of that value, on average
Void pits and giant spikes still cause lag spikes, but that is understandable due to their large nature
Revert light level change to tall grass and logs, give them minimal light
Add new bleach tree for the starlit biomes to replace the balloon tree, it is a basic small tree

1.38.1646 <173> (October 14, 2014)
Added Polaris to Starlit Praries spawn
Reimplement the sky in the Dimension
Fix up exception handling for the entity drop helper, this shouldn't crash anymore even without it as I've fixed all of the possible bugs with it, but just in case I forget
whenever I add new entities
Start updating the Polaris AI, it's AI is greatly simplified, it no longer spams fireballs when it's health is low as fire doesn't really fit it too well, it can now create a
clone when it's health is below half when it teleports, causing confusion to the player
Remove quicksand as a drop from the Polaris, it can now drop various durations/types of invisibility potions
Reduce overall duration of vanilla potion effects (effects inflicted by vanilla mobs that I added)
Updating the Empariah(Yeti) AI now, it'll use a wider ranged Demeanor system from the Reaper, when it's not being aggressive it'll stay back and throw rocks, it has lower
armor while this is happening, otherwise it leaps towards it's target, when angry it'll also sometimes stop and use a frost breath attack, sometimes it'll stop and roar, which
will allow it to summon a bunch of Abominations to help it
Also reduce damage it takes from projectiles
Improved regeneration of Golden Sushi by one amplifier, it gives a tiny amount of invincibility now as well (about 5 seconds)
I was going to create a new Yeti model, but I just slightly modified the newest one, adding more detail to the crown and fixing the foot claws
Added necessary nbt data for the Yeti (almost forgot)
Removed some logger spam
Doing an interim build for CommodoreAlpha as soon as we get internet back

1.38.1668 <174> (October 16, 2014)
Added some sounds for the Jabba, Janna and Jarra
Fixing some things with corruption, it should no longer apply huge amounts of corruption to nearby entities that are already corrupted, this should eliminate the issue of getting
30 minutes of corruption just from being around things that are corrupted
Added new utility method for getting if an entity is within a certain range for bosses
Fix up some issues with attacking the Enyvil (or any future multipart entity) with a melee attack, it uses my reach enchantment event in order to attack any multipart entities
within a certain range
Fix initial bug with double-hitting entities within normal melee range
Added proper death strings to my custom damage sources, I just looked into how vanilla does it since it's been bothering me
Beginning the complete rewrite of the Time Controller AI now
Added it's Quantum Leap ability, which teleports nearby entities to their position from a few seconds ago (this is to confuse things and just cause mischief wherever they are)
Added it's Time Flux attack, which is the previous Gravity Flux attack along with randomly setting the world time, it absorbs damage during this time and inflicts it onto all
entities that attack it
Added it's Purge attack, it will inflict a huge horizontal knockback hit and damages anything near it
Added it's Spaz attack, which should teleport entities near it to random spots and it should teleport itself to random spots as well, it'll also spawn time bombs
Finishing up the Time Disruption and Time Bomb code
The Time Disruption reuses the Large Rock's model, it doesn't look too good but I'll make a new model another time, it now knocks nearby entities into random directions and
damages them
There was a bug with attacking/doing things after the Time Controller teleports you, this has been fixed (I think), this was due to how the teleport would occur, it'd be called
client-side and server-side but pick a random spot on both that didn't always match up, so you'd think you were in one spot, but you're really in another spot
Removed some parts from the Enyvil, it is really laggy so I'm going to possibly remove more parts from it but we'll see
Made Time Controller immune to projectiles when it is doing it's Purge attack
Made Time Controller unable to get potion effects put onto it
I'm going to basically fully rewrite the Envil, but it'll maintain most of it's attacks in addition to being able to detroy blocks it collides with
Fixed up Enyvil's AI, it uses a TON of datawatchers, but it still works pretty effectively, trying to do it's particle effects right now, then I'll work on it's model and
animations tomorrow (or later, whenever)
It also lags a lot less than it did before, so that's a good sign, fixed up it's interaction with the dark crystals, they now work more effectively
Remove Jabba sounds, temporarily until I add the other mob's sounds and adjust them and such
Bump version number again, this is to check if an issue with Twilight Forest (and possibly other Dimensional mods) is resolved

1.38.1678 <175> (October 22, 2014)
The issue was fixed with using reach on the twilight forest mobs, but I have no idea what caused it, possibly due to how the Twilight Forest dimension is set up
Added Enyvil's animations and updated it's model, it now can break blocks if it can't move horizontally or if it takes damage from being inside of a block
Added a few new blocks for the Overlord Tower, I have the basic design for the tower I want to do, now all I have to do is create the schematic and set up the whole thing
Also added the blocks for the Overlord Dimension, the Overlord is going to be a cyborg alien thing now, instead of just an alien thing, maybe I could make it summon swarms
of nanobots in addition to the Underlings that it'll spawn, the swarms of nanobots will work like the bomb clones of the Skultar, which will die on impact with their target
Updated the Claymation's AI now to fit with all of the new rewritten AI, and to also animate each model separately based off of utility values
Finished up all of the Claymation's forms, this includes each model's separate animations
Added the Reaper Scythe's weapon model, along with all of the Epic weapon models
Fix Emapariah's rock throwing animation a bit, it now doesn't do a weird slow arm movement the entire time when it can throw them, it just does it when it's about to, it isn't
quite in sync but it's close enough
Fix Empariah rendering on fire, derp
Bump version number for actual release!

1.38.1698 <176> (October 25, 2014)
Fix derp in Ragr's arm animation
Added new Luminescence enchantment, it can be applied to weapons, tools and armor
Updated the Clarity effect, it was meant to create a huge amount of particles around an invisible enemy so that you know where they are, but it creates blocks since the
client renders particles as such when they aren't spawned in using packets, the blocks work better than particle effects would have so I'm actually going to keep it like that
Added the LeadFoot effect, based off of the Heavy effect in Lycanite's Mobs mod, hopefully people don't think I'm just stealing it, it's a really nice idea
Reduced Kitsunakuma and Polaris's knockback resistance to 0
Reduced overall chance of Time Controller to spaz out when it's health is low, it's fine doing it every now and then, but it does it basically every other hit, which is way
too often for what the ability does and how many hits it can take
Added Luminescence, Lead Foot, Hacked, Convergence and the mobs, Lockbot, Locobot, Nano Swarm, Aegar, Overlord to the config
Added config option to prevent animals and golems from being corruptible
Added initializations of all of the new config options
Added localizations for the last group of blocks added, as well as for all of the mobs, effects and enchantments added
Added Convergence effect, it will now randomly quickly give you Doom, this may be given by a certain Doomsday or you may get it from wearing the full Overlord armor set (or both)
You can also get it when you use a Blood or Nourishment Sacrifice
Renamed Agility to Elude
Fix sound pitch of Jabba family
Added new Enchantments to some of the weapon's Enchantment tiers
Update the last group of blocks added to use metadata, adjusted localizations
Adjusted them to have slightly longer time to mine, made them have way higher explosive resistance
Added recipes for the Celled Lamps and for Celled blocks, as they will only generate in Overlord Towers
Allow Circuit blocks to give off redstone signals (only the live or damaged ones will do this)
Fix derp in Celestial Aegis enchantment tier
Fixed bug with Invulnerability negating things that should always kill you, this was an oversight but is fixed up now
This should wrap up all of the pre-huge update stuff

1.39.1721 [The Start of some huge changes for the mod] <177> (October, 28, 2014)
Modified Quicksand physics
Modified how Enchantments are added to vanilla entities from my vanilla changing event
Modified how Entity drops work, variants also now have separate drops from their main form
Added more Looting for the Epic weapons, I didn't realize that most of them didn't have it, with it being so important for my mob's drops this was a pretty huge oversight
Moved Boss luxury drops into the drop helper rather than keeping them in the TragicBoss class, this allows for easier use of it, they were converted to use the random weighted
system as well
Due to the change in drops, some of the mobs drops were changed, more variety was added to some of them (generally, the tougher mobs got more drops)
Adding Nano Swarm and Psygote (I'll work on their models and animations after getting their AI)
Adding armor textures now, Tungsten, Red Mercury and Hunter's armor will use the normal armor models, but Light, Dark and Overlord armor will use custom models
Finished up more of the new mob drops, added Tentacles for Squid to drop, these can be crafted into sushi (alongside the other vanilla fish)
Fix up some derps in vanilla mob drops (dropping my items)
Add all of the Doomsday Scrolls properly to the ChestGenHooks, actually add the Amulet Release to the ChestGenHooks, this was a MAJOR derp
Fix the Enderman Amulet, it wasn't actually Silk Touching any of the blocks you mined, now I kinda do a fake block mine, deny the player breaking the block and just set the
block to air and spawn an item entity of the block at the block's location
Added Psygote's switch ability and it's mortor spam ability
Changed the Light/Dark particle textures, the Dark particle was pretty hard to see against the Gui background and the Light one was changed to match it (since they are opposite)
Finished up the Psygote's AI, may add one more projectile attack as it doesn't seem to attack enough but otherwise it's finished, model and animations included
Psygote now shoot a single dark mortor while they are fleeing from their attack target
Modifying WorldGen now, slightly, adding the Tainted biome set and possibly adding two other biome sets as well
Changed how weapons with two Doomsdays use their abilities, now you sneak + hit the button you set to use the Doomsday and it'll use the 2nd one, or just hit the button to
use the first one
Fix problem with shooting fireballs on right-click with the Dragon Fang
Reduce spread of Fire Rain Doomsday, it now rains fireballs in a tighter spread around you, it also now gives you fire resistance so that you don't take as much damage from
the fireballs (the fire at least)
Added a custom sky render, currently I just use a modified version of the End's render, but I want to have it look kinda circuit-y, like with a pulsating circuit in the sky
Started adding the basic entity class for the Aegar, I'm planning it's AI right now then I'll start to actually implement it, otherwise I'll keep working on other miscellaneous
things
Modifying how the ItemBlocks for the blocks are done to reduce the amount of classes I have total, added the last couple of bosses to the summon blocks (forgot)
Unfortunately, this will heavily corrupt worlds from previous versions (only really affects the Dimension)
The Dimension is now named the Collision

1.39.1756 <178> (November 4, 2014)
Added textures for the Enyvil and Claymation summon blocks, modified the Ender Dragon and Polaris ones as they looked too similar to the Enyvil one
Removed lava generation for the tainted isles and lowlands biome, however, the isle generation is still quite laggy, this will have to be necessary though
Started planning for the new biome sets that I will add, this will add way more variety in the collision and will give a really "collided" feel to the Dimension
Prevent Multipart entities from taking damage via lightning, fix up some more bugs with the Reach enchantment, it should now work in other Dimensional mods (need to test this)
Fix Challenge scrolls not properly giving a completion for stand on block challenges, this was due to it being improperly labeled an item challenge, added difficulty label to
the scroll description so it is easier to determine the difficulty of a particular challenge
Added new rewards for completing harder challenges, fixed another issue with armor challenges
Added Hacked Potion Effect along with a Gui overlay to render the effect, it looks pretty cool
Experimented with using the circuit texture for the sky in the dimension, it'll work well for the Synapse dimension sky
Updated spawn egg colors for the Nano Swarm, Erkel and Psygote
Updated the Ash and Nasty Fruit texture, ash texture was updated due to looking too similar to the Dark Particle one, Nasty Fruit was updated to to it's recipe requiring some
ectoplasm
Updated Tungsten Jack texture, it looks way cooler, maybe a bit too cool lol
Started work on the Aegar's AI, getting the multipart entity stuff out of the way on it before I work on it's actual attacks and such
Fix issue with hitting a multipart entity with a melee weapon, it was because I wasn't setting the part positions and updating them on the client-side, the client-side was
then attacking the entity itself which returns false on any hit so that it does nothing, however, switching the attack target to it's default part remedied this issue
Since I finished messing with the Aegar's parts and also fixed a long standing issue with multipart entities in my mod, I can now start on it's AI and attacks
The Aegar will have a drop that can be crafted into a new block that can be used to make the Circuit Golem
Added Dimensional Keys for the Nether, the End and the Synapse, there is no Overworld one as using any of the keys twice should return you there anyway, they are all in the
Creative tab now (including the Collision one)
Created a new type of crafting recipe for fusing weapons to upgrade their lore/rarity, you can now get 4 common weapons and combine them up to an epic weapon, each one requires
an ore charm to fuse though, added for all of my weapons and armor
Added new texture for the alternative Dimensional Keys, there will be a synapse link item created that has 5 uses, it'll basically be the same as the Synapse Dimensional Key
Created a texture for Aegar in normal and hypermode, added a partical effect to also help illustrate the change
Increased base health of it's crystal so that it takes longer to break it and send it into hypermode, also added it's nbt tags, going to start work on it's animations and attacks
now
Added it's movement speed modifier as well, I'll keep it's extra long reach as an attack feature
Added the Mini-Boss drops, moved the Mini-Boss entity classes into their own package, I'm going to split the models into packages as well as there is too many
Attempt to allow vanilla entities to damage my multipart entities, doesn't look like it's going to happen so I reverted that change
Fix memory leak from Claymation, this was due to me instancing new models every render tick, which I didn't realize I was doing when I created the render, this was also the cause
of some of the memory leaks with the statues, though that was also due to opengl rendering
Reduce cost of Nature Drain, I didn't realize it was an extended doomsday so it cost way too much for normal use
Improved Combustion, if any block that is mined with it is smeltable (it has a furnace recipe), it'll now be auto-smelted and you will get the amount of drops based on the tool's
current fortune level
Changes to the bows, Hunter's Bow now fires faster than the Vanilla bow, but not spammable fast, Celestial Longbow now fires way slower and has a higher minimum tension required
to fire
Made the Thardus and Frozen Lightning inflict magic damage on entities rather than normal hit damage
Fix a minor offset in the Challenge scroll description for their difficulty level
Reduced Aegar's defense, it is way too high, reduce it's attack damage and attack speed as well, otherwise it can basically insta-kill anything that gets near it
Finished up Aegar's animations, it should now be complete, bugs notwithstanding
Added the automatic laser fire for it when it's in hyper mode to act as another reason to not put it into firewall hypermode
Added the Synapse Crystal, which can be combined into a Synapse Core, which will be able to store a redstone charge for a couple minutes after being charged and will also be
able to be used with live circuit blocks to create a Circuit Golem
Also added the Synapse Link, which should drop every time it dies, which basically is the same thing as the Synapse Dimensional Key except with only 10 uses
Added Aegar and Overlord statues, the Overlord doesn't have a model so it uses the Nano Swarm's model for the statue
Added textures for the Synapse Link, Synapse Crystal and Synapse Core
Finished up the Synapse Dimension (for now), it now generates similarly to the Nether but made fully of Circuit blocks, I'll do some worldgen to change the metadata values but
for now it is good enough, there is no bedrock ceiling or floor, as well, the areas closest to the top and bottom generate sorta "faded", I'm debating if I should add void pits
to this Dimension as a feature to make cooler looking areas

2.40.1770 [Creating the first Big Boss of the mod, as well as doing other huge rewrites/changes that I've been putting off] <179> (November 13, 2014)
Fixed being able to attack entities through walls with the Reach enchantment this makes attacking entities near walls a bit wonky, but is necessary to prevent a cheap way of
attacking things
Created basic entity class for the Overlord, experimenting with it's final form's motion, which will use a modified version of the Pirah's except it'll use a target intead of
random motion offsets to determine where it's going
Did more work on the Overlord's final form movements, it works adequately, though I'll work on a way to smooth it out a bit more later on
Allow the Overlord to randomly hover in place now, at this time planning to block incoming projectiles with it's barrier blocks and will fire crystal mortors at it's target (if it has
any targets, otherwise it'll fire them at random locations around it) whenever it's hovering
I have decided that I need to split off the Overlord into 3 separate classes as I previously planned to, each form has a different amount of parts (if it is multipart) and then
also has different movement patterns which needs to be put into it's update method an then they also have different attack patterns and it'll just be easier to spawn the next
form after a small transformation phase from the previous form
Fixed Greater Stin model offsets
I need to create a model before I do the multipart stuff for the Overlord so that I can set their locations and the amount of parts to fit it
Added dynamic healing, the amount it heals per few seconds depends on how many players are near it, I think I'll use this for the other Bosses as well
Added methods in the boss superclass for that purpose
Added Leadfoot to Gragul/Kragul which replaces their nausea/blindness effect, changed potion icon for the Hacked effect, added Leadfoot to the Time Controller when it's using
it's Quantum Leap ability, to make it more difficult to attack it during that time
Fixed Pirah not extinguishing in water
Fixed Disorientation not working due to changes brought out with Clarity working on Servers
Fixed Challenges based on killing or finding entities based on superclass
Fixed up some minor things with bosses taking damage from stronger weapons (anything over 30 and not done by a creative mode player would be negated completely)
Rewrote the projectile items to use one class and item id now, this also will modify their renders to be simplified greatly, each one will have a new unique texture now
Modified the creative projectile item to use vector based direction rather than if a block is in range and using that block's coodinates
Fixed gravity velocity with the rock projectiles
Reduce amount of "idle" time the Tragic Neko has while doing it's attack cycle
Fixed bug with Withering Axe's right click ability (firing wither skulls) wouldn't actually take doom unless you were in Creative
Fixed bug with Titan's right-click lightning not using Doom (it was lowering coolown instead, derp)
Made it so that all weapon's non-Doomsday abilities now require the player to have no global cooldown active and force each one to use vector-based directions for projectiles
Fixed up Beastly Claws to use NBT tags to control it's cooldown instead of using an arbitrary variable in the item class (which would be static regardless of the context so it
would cause bugs with more than one person using it)
Convert the few Doomsdays that used mop to use the hit vector, this should fix poison barb's flight path, but I'll keep it reversed
Change the Inkling's torch breaking to use the same method the Enyvil uses to break blocks, as well, do the same for the Miner Skills doomsday
Update the cooldown variables used in the weapons to be nbt tags instead of arbitrary variables in the item classes, which were basically static variables that would affect all
items in current existence, client-server syncing notwithstanding, now each one is treated separately per itemstack and will have a set cooldown rate of 5, which should be barely
noticeable for pretty much everyone, this is to prevent you from using an ability multiple times on one click
Fixed the Neko Launcher firing a missile client side
Bump version number for testing (for streaming)

2.40.1798 <180> (December 1, 2014)
Possibly fix targetting issues with my mobs and improve it a bit (hopefully) this needs to be tested but it's apparently a very rare crash as it hasn't happened before so it's not too
big of a deal
Upon further thought, I've decided that the final form of the Overlord doesn't need to be multipart
Changed a few of the Talismans to use anonymous classes rather than having them override one thing and use a superclass, part of my desire to have as few useless classes as possible
Remove empty LifeWater class, may have been planning to use that for a bonemeal type of effect but I can do that later on
Move all of the items in the "special" package to the normal item package, there is no need for a separate package for these as if they have their own class they are generally going to
be "special" anyway
Created a new block class for the Overlord Barrier, there is a lot needed for it that necessitates it's own class rather than an anonymous class
Remove Magnetar and Pulsar, removed recipes, the Gravity Orb will be used for an amulet at some point so it should actually gain worth
Change the Generator item to use the vector based position rather than the block hit position, update them to use metadata of one item since it is a Creative only item and doesn't
necessitate separate identifiers, at least not internally
In the future, I'll add some of the vanilla generators like cave and ravine generators, also will add some of the vanilla structures like mineshafts and villages
Fixed biome decoration for the Synapse, implementing variant Circuit block generation, using a modified ice path gen to create the swathes of dead circuits within the dimension
Fixed a warning flag with my custom weapon recipe in order to resolve possible conflicts, this is good to know for future recipes I may create
Experimenting with a better method for the Overlord final form's movement, most of this month will be dedicated to getting the Overlord setup
Changed config name of natural boss spawns to be overworld boss spawns (since that's what it was used for mostly anyway), this is now defaulted to false
Modified Properties to no longer utilize a temporary hashmap to save proxy data for them, they should now maintain properties through death and dimension change without
Modified Corruption recovery to use an entity's UUID rather than their temporary id from the tracker
Fix localizations of the WorldGen items, used the wrong string array in the item class
I'm going to restart work on the Overlord's motion, it's not working how I want it to so I'll set it up to be either more simplified or to parallel a vanilla entity, most likely using
a combination of the Ender Dragon and Ghast's movement
This is mostly with how the Overlord was not properly saving it's target destination and then would arbitrarily move to a random spot that didn't match it's target, it would also completely
ignore actual entities that it could target
Changing the drop of the Death Reaper from Reaper Skull to Deathly Hallow (that's a Harry Potter reference right there, yep), this is to make more sense for it to drop more than one of it
Added the Bosses drops back to the drop helper
Updated to Forge 10.13.2.1240, wrote a small batch program to update this easier
Added new option to change the amount you gain from Doom Consumes as well as the max amount you start with
Added config options to disable specific Doomsdays
Added config options for each Doomsday's cost and cooldown
Added these to the Doomsdays, this greatly simplifies their construction, so much in fact I may not even need static methods to reference them at this point
Remove unused imports in Doomsdays, remove the IExtendedDoomsday marker as a separate class, it is now nested inside the Doomsday class
Added config option to disable time altering items/blocks, at this point is only the Time Manipulator Talisman and Time Disruptor block
Added config option for the default position of the gui
Added config options to set each mob, miniboss and boss's particular stats, including armor value
Added config option to disable weapon models
Fix minor derps in statue textures/models

2.40.1835 <181> (Decemeber 9, 2014)
Updated to Forge 13.10.2.1258, that batch program is really useful
Minor fix in Nor-Vox to reduce idle time between attacks
I need to test out all of the mobs in a Survival situation to make sure their AI is working properly
Reduce charging speed of the Minotaur and Apis
Added config option to disable snow golem spawns (in regards to my mod)
Re-added config option to disable dynamic health scaling, I didn't realize I removed this
Cleaned up some AttributeModifiers that I use for mobs and such, made them configurable due to the fact that mob stats are configurable now
Added the few Doomsdays and non-mob destructive features to the config, allowing whether they are destructive or not
Removed extraneous statue events class, it is now handled inside the statue entity itself
Remove extraneous "main" package, move all classes in it to the true main package, that's a lot of import refactoring
Updated ReadMe.txt
Extended Doomsdays update the amount they use per iteration instead of all at once, the cooldown is applied after the effect is used
Combination Doomsdays now inflict cooldown based on that particular Doomsdays's cooldown, plus the cooldown of the combined Doomsdays, the iterations allowed by the extended one plus
the cost of using the instant one
Fixed meta values of blocks in the Growth Spurt Doomsday, double plants now have the proper upper blocks and stay
Added a debugger to see what is causing the most lag within the mod, for initialization the Config, Entities and Items are understandably taking a larger portion of the time, however,
I'm unsure as to why the network handlers are taking so long, but it's possibly due to the fact that it uses a network wrapper for netty and it takes some time to set these up within
it
Fix NBT Tags for Polaris
Update some storage block textures, particularly the Tungsten, Red Mercury and Ruby block textures
Dark stone will now drop dark cobblestone, added some recipes added to obtain the variants, including the light cobblestone variants, added light stone
Added more of the blocks to the ore dictionary
Slightly update FlowerWorldGen
Converted the Pitch Black entity to a throwable projectile, so that it has better gravity
Fixed possible NPE with weapons that had two doomsdays
Fixed possible bug with Cooldown not being applied when Doomsday abilities are disabled
Rewriting how Lore is chosen and applied, it should still allow custom lore and rarity to be set, in fact now you can choose a specific lore from the preset lores if you know the id
and rarity tier, there is now an overall 10% chance for a weapon to be "epic" rarity, and then the chosen lores have set weights in their own rarity tiers
While it would be better to have each weapon have a large pool of lores which have different weights, that wouldn't quite work for custom lores
Removed unnecessary tag compound for Beastly Claws, keeping track of the damage amount when it depends on the combo count is redundant
Fixed continous errors brought forth by inputting a custom id that was too high
Fixed bugs with WorldGen, apparently WorldGenMinable doesn't like amounts that are lower than 3
Added new ToolMaterials for the Harmony Bell and Neko Launcher
Removed the ID system for the Lore, this didn't work quite correctly and complicated the matter of finding a lore for a rarity, as such the Lore basically works off of the previously
used system except that it is cleaner and all in one spot now instead of scattered across multiple classes
Fixed error loop with a weapon that had it's rarity set to common
Fixed bug that didn't allow weapons to have a common rarity
Fixed bug with a null string being saved from a common rarity item, it now gets saved as "" which is an empty string but isn't null
Fixed bug with duplicating Star Crystals by breaking them with an open hand, reduced their hardness so that they mine somewhat faster, make it so that they always drop dyes unless they
are silk touched
Fix bug with Star pieces recipe giving the wrong color of star crystal
Added new star crystal recipes to craft them from dyes and wisp particles
Added my custom flowers to savanna and swamps
Added ability to grow my custom flowers in each biome that they can generate in, stapelia can generate in any of these biomes when bonemeal is used but it's very uncommon
Optimized FlowerWorldGen a bit

2.40.1857 <182> (December 15, 2014)
Updated to Forge 13.10.2.1264
Improved efficiency of the Scythe, it now works on more materials, it can now be extended by other classes better, rather than having all of the Lore and Doomsday stuff in just the
Reaper Scythe class
Finally fix NPE with targetting for mobs
Updated efficiency of Withering Axe on wood and Tungsten Jack on everything, split the Tungsten Jack into a separate class to allow for more than one version of it and to allow easily
extending the class to create a new hybrid weapon
Rewrote the Amulets, fixed initial issues with getting the proper icon for them, changed their recipes to utilize the new nbt tags for them, reduced the amount of game registry entrants
with this method and cleaned up that section of code
Modified the AmuletHelper and the Amulet Event Handler to use the new nbt tag system and their ids rather than just using their names (which was a stupid system to begin with)
Finish adding the rest of the weapon/armor/item lores, update Doomsdays
Added the basic jack, changed the Enigma Shield to a Celestial Jack, craftable from Celestial Steel and Celestial Diamonds
Lowered the Tungsten Jack's durability, the basic jack is craftable with flint and quicksilver, the Celestial Jack has higher base efficiency than the Tungsten Jack
Updated Doomsdays to no longer use arbitrary variables to save their necessary information, DoomsdayEffect now contains utility variables for use by each one
Fixed Poison Break firing the wrong direction
Fixed initial bugs with conversion of DoomsdayEffect to use utility values, mostly involved with updating the Doomsday (such derps here, I don't even)
Added exception handling for the DoomsdayEffect so that if anything goes wrong with a particular Doomsday, it won't crash the game and it'll remove the effect but will log it
Modified Marionette to choose the entity closest to you when the effect is done
Fixed initial bug with Amulet icons
Registered the Modifiers that the amulets will use now on the player
Running into some problems with getting the modifiers from the nbt tag of the itemstack, no idea what is causing it to not read them properly from it
Quicksand affects all entities now instead of just players, trying to make it so that horses with a player riding them can get out of it
Adjusted some of the mob's default health and attack
Fix explicit casts on player entities in the Doom and Amulet events, this is to prevent issues with mods that use entities that extend EntityPlayer (for whatever reason)
Upon testing with Balkon's weapon mod, there is no negative knockback at all
Bump version numbers for testing with mod compatibilities

2.40.1868 <183> (December 24, 2014)
Updated Death Reaper AI again, removed random projectiles it fires, it now shoots Large Pumpkinbombs while being aggressive and Wither Skulls while being defensive, it will now spawn
in wither gas when it gets attacked or attack something, which damages entities within it with wither damage (if they aren't undead)
Added Wither Gas block, may add a few variants of this for other entities (most likely the mortor entities)
Rewrote AmuletModifiers, idk what I was on the first time I wrote them but they work now and also apply to the itemstack correctly, but they don't display properly on the description
Added new Dark Sandstone blocks, it has a few different variants similar to other "natural" blocks in the mod
Added recipes for them, Dark Sand -> Rough Sandstone -> Smooth Sandstone -> Bricked/Carved Sandstone -> Gridded/Chiseled Sandstone
Carved requires Dark particles
Updated Reaper's Laugh to fire small Pumpkinbombs in random directions around you, large pumpkinbombs are too destructive and in fact have a very high chance to kill a player without
op armor on
Creating the Guardian Doomsday, created new shield entities, completely experimental as I've never made something like this before
I need to update the shield entity to use a datawatcher so that I can get the owner on client-side to update the rotation of the model correctly
Maybe I'll change it to be a EntityProjectile rather than a living entity so that it keeps it's motion once it's set and it has built in owner capability
Updated a few later tier recipes, involving creation of Lunar Powder and Time Disruption cube, this is to make the item flow more circular on this particular tier
Added recipe for the Aegar Tower structure seed, may change to a custom block to have some prerequisites that the seeds don't (like placing at y=64 or something)
Fixed issues with Modifiers on Amulets, now I just need to apply them to the player every tick while they are in the amulet slots instead of only when they are in the player's hands
and then ensure that modifiers are removed when the effect is taken off
Modified Amulet Container to allow players to shift-click amulets to an active amulet slot, rather than having to place it manually each time
Added config option to disable amulet modifiers and set each modifier's chance to be applied
Added config options to disable specific non-Doomsday abilities like the Beastly Claws's Combo
Fix Gravity Spike's launch ability
Apply cooldown on some abilities that were unintentionally exempt from it
Fix inverted logic on the Guilty Thorn's ability for creative mode players
Added config options to set each non-Doomsday ability's cost
The config options are a bit messy internally (like the mob stats) but the configurability is pretty nice
Default the Amulet GUI to open with the Y key
Slight modification to the Life Water recipe to no longer require Enchanted Books

2.40.1880 <184> (January 2, 2015)
Allow Pumpkinhead to spawn regardless of it there is a pumpkin near it's spawn, this allows for it to spawn under normal circumstances
It will attempt to generate a pumpkin 25% of the time if there is not one near it when it spawns, this is to alleviate the need for it to generate one each time it spawns
Added Amulet Modifier transfer to the Amulet upgrading, it will only transfer one of the Amulet's modifiers (the first one in the crafting grid), this was supposed to work with
both of their modifiers but for some reason it doesn't get it for both
Reduce amount of Pumpkinheads that can spawn in one chunk, lowered it's default spawn rate, reduced the amount of biomes it can generate in
Modified Projectile superclass, added a new method to determine if the projectile can be deflected by things
Updated the Tuple I use for the Modifier transfer to be my custom one rather than the vanilla util one, this is so that I can parameterize it
Increase the size of the Guardian Shields so that they deflect projectiles better, fix their health so that it can actually be higher than 20, crucial moments with the Doomsday now
heal half the player's health
Fixed bug with the Jump Modifier not having the right default value
Reduce chance for Pumpkinhead to generate a pumpkin when it spawns, reduce radius in which it checks for nearby pumpkins on update
Fix bug with Stin's attributes
Update the Claymation's Skultar form to fire the correct projectiles
Added Sharpen/Harden Doomsdays, Sharpen serves as the first Doomsday for the Sentinel weapon, Guardian's Call is it's second but they do not form a Combination Doomsday together
Added localizations for the new Doomsdays and the new weapon

2.40.1904 <185> (January 8, 2015)
Removed unnecessary object arrays in recipes
Adjusted methods inside of the Time Disruption Cube's block class in order to simplify it and to allow for it to be easily modifiable in the case that I want to add another boss
spawn with it
Update the Celestial Longbow and Hunter's Bow classes to use less total code and take away the Celestial Longbow's built in infinity ability
Added new utility method to get modified positioning from the side hit of a vector, useful for transports based on vector location
Added Divination potion effect
Removed TragicTabs and the two tab classes, they aren't important enough to even require their own classes as such they are now anonymous classes registered and declared in the
main class, this however, causes a bunch of import errors for other classes
Removed unneeded pressure plate block classes in favor of anonymous classes since they were empty anyway
Combined TragicPotions into TragicPotion, it's been bothering me that they were treated as separate classes so now it is more efficient having them combined
Changed Divination to Divinity
Fixed arbitrary variables in Gooey Fruit's item class
Actually updated part of the mod to 1.8, but the whole thing won't be updated for a while, for now I'm just messing with it to get the hang of the new block and item rendering
stuff, as well as the entity changes and blockstate/pos things
Updated Overlord Core's movement, literally just copied parts of the code from the Ender Dragon, but I'm going to add in a hovering ability, which it'll spawn crystal mortors and
be immune to damage, it'll be "hurt" from any hit but will only take damage from entities that have the Divinity effect active, which will be gained from crystal mortors that
do not directly impact their target (it'll spawn a dimensional tear/atrophy which grants the effect upon collision with other entities)
The Overlord Core now "sheds" Nano Swarms when it actually takes damage, updated Nano Swarm entity to not attack or damage the Overlord
Massive code cleanup from an automated task in Eclipse, this was mostly to override everything that needed to be overridden within the code (and cleanup imports) so that updating
to 1.8 would be easier
Added aggregate ability to the Overlord, in which if it gets aggravated enough from non damaging attacks, it targets the entity that attacked it last and hovers
If it gets damaged while hovering, it'll break out of hovering
Allow Gragul/Kragul to be killed by the Sword/Bow of Justice
Added other spawning structures for the other 6 bosses with various other blocks, all of them require a time disruption cube though
The Overlord Core will now "shed" nano swarms while it's health is low, regardless of being damaged, from current testing the Overlord Core is very difficult to kill, however, I
need more testing and with more "preparation" in order to accurately determine if the Overlord is not only killable but very difficult to kill as well
Adding a screen overlay for the divinity effect to more easily let the player know that the effect is active for them
Applied the same screen overlay for the Convergence effect only with a red tint, convergence now also prevents the player from having global cooldown on doomsday use
Adding more of the Lores as I do other random stuff
Moved proxy registrations into the init due to how 1.8 is currently setup regarding item/block renders
Rearranged the registration cycle of the mod, this shouldn't affect anything

2.40.1929 <186> (January 14, 2015)
Removed all of the short and byte specifications in the main doomsday class, this should clean up some code
Did some more experimentation with updating to 1.8, added a couple of new (commented out) things to prep for that
Slowed down speed of Overlord Mortors, allow Dimensional Anomalies to fall to the ground slowly so that they don't hang up in the air if they are spawned there
Added a Synapse creature attribute to prevent them from targetting each other
Reduced the time the Dimensional Anomalies stay "alive", allow Overlord Core to be hit by any entities after being initially hit by an entity with Divinity for a certain amount
of time
Added a semi-transparent Digital Sea block that generates in the upper and lower sections of the Synapse, it's meant to give it a moodier look, although it may be removed if it
causes too much lag, originally I wanted it to sorta "spark" to life in waves when touched but in large amounts this generates a huge amount of lag
Added conduit block, which may get the digital sea's "spark" aspect since the digital sea generates in too large of chunks
Added world gen for the conduits, which generate using the glowstone's worldgen, although it uses two variants of it for the two that it uses
Improved rendering for Star Crystals and the Disappearing Block to better render sides
Added debug for synapse worldgen, to see what is taking the longest
Improved Dead Circuit worldgen in Synapse, it no longer causes huge hangs (there are some minimal hangs but that's normal for generating new chunks anyway)
Improved worldgen in various spots by switching the way the WorldHelper method for getting spherical areas is looped
Added model and render for the Guardian Shields, they don't look very shield-like but they do have a custom pulsating effect to them
Added render for the Time Disruptions, these use the same model as the Guardian Shields but modifies the animations to make it look unique
Dimensional Anomaly does not use a model, instead it uses multiple particle effects in order to make it easily visible against the Synapse dimension's color scheme, although I may
add a conduit-like model for it with high brightness (that twitches randomly) to make it even easier to spot
Added Corrupted Gas for the Overlord's first two forms
Reduced amount of the Hacked effect inflicted from the Nano Swarms so that it isn't an instant death when you get inflicted once, however, it'll still be difficult if there are a lot
of them surrounding you inflicting the effect
Updated Eclipse and this updated a bunch of files in it
Change Gas block to identify as an air block
Updated the DoomsdayManager, since there was a bug that allowed any combination of any allowed doomsday combinations to be activated, it now checks for specific combinations and also
uses less hashmaps and such, so this should speed up functionality of it too
Fixed initial concurrency bug with the update to the DoomsdayManager
Added sneak ticks to Doomsday effects, this is due to the fact that some combination doomsdays require the same weapon (which requires a sneak+special use to activate), this would
cancel the extended one immediately and prevent the combination from being activated
It now takes about a second of sneaking to cancel an extended one, but the effect is stalled while sneaking to prevent extra doom use
Lifewater renamed to Enchanted Tears, since it is technically tears (ghast tears), it now has an "enchanted" glow to match the name
I just reviewed all of the armor textures, along with their damaged ones and they all work fine, so this is possibly another build glitch with textures

2.40.1964 <187> (January 22, 2015)
Working on the Overlord Core model, fixed initial issue with the model being rotated 180 degrees from the overlord's actual rotation
Experimented with a rainbow effect for the Divinity effect, this will probably not be used due to other reasons
Added the Overlord Armor, each piece gives you 5 extra health (2.5 hearts), allowing you to have up to 20 hearts of health
Allow Divinity to heal you some randomly, as well, make it remove the Hacked effect from you
Overlord armor now prevents you from getting weakness/cripple, essentially stopping the respawn debuffs, although they will still affect you for a tick so you
will have the debuffed health amount
Updated some code in the EntityList I use for my spawn eggs
Added the Silent Hellraiser, it'll have no preset enchantment tiers, it'll be a boss drop and challenge reward, it is stronger than epic weapons but has no doomsday
Added Flamethrower ability to Dragon Fang
Invulnerability no longer negates Flight
Clarity now renders the particles instead of boxes, though it's harder to see in some instances it has the same effect
Challenge rewards now use EntityDrops from the DropHelper to give weighted rewards, so now some rewards are more common than others, added a few new rewards and
reduced chance of getting some rewards by consolidating them into a single instance rather than having them skew the rewards by having multiple (amulets, epic weapons, spawn eggs, etc.)
Added Frozen Netherrack block, changed Light Cobblestone to require Lightning Orbs instead of Ice Orbs to craft in survival
Frozen Netherrack requires Ice Orbs and Netherrack
Created new package for Alphas (endboss caliber bosses), moved Overlord classes to it, moved Guardian Shield to the Projectile package since it is technically a projectile
Updated code for Mob Dungeons in the dimension, they had the wrong blocks as the base and cleaned up some other code for it as well
Increased chance for Mob Dungeons to generate in the Dimension
Fix bug with Star Cryse (missed one double in it's stat configurations)
Added AttributeModifier of the Overlord Armor to the config file
Specify class extensions for the LoreHelper and DropHelper
The Overlord Core model is probably the highest detailed model I've ever made (and probably will ever make, it's taking so long omg)
Updated code for the Synapse dimension, sped up Conduit generation and modified Dead Circuit generation
Modified Circuit blocks to allow mobs to spawn naturally on them, Nano Swarms may now spawn in the Dimension
Added textures for the Overlord Core, got more work done on it's model but it's not quite done yet
Increased speed in which it flies through and destroys blocks
Fixed WorldGen for Sapphire/Ruby in Nether
Added Debug option for the Neko Neko Wand that allows you to see all of the ore distribution in a specific chunk, only does my ores and vanilla as thats
all I care about
Fixed WorldGen for Stone Layers
Optimized WorldGen for the Collision again, mostly involving the stone layers and the spikes generation
Fixed bug with Spike generation that didn't actually generate the spike variants the proper way, this created some more lag for their generation but some
other optimizations were done to alleviate that some
Prevent dirt from generating in spikes, ores will still generate since they would be difficult to get to anyway (without creative mode flight anyway)
Change how mixed dirt is generated in Decaying biomes
Reduced chance of Erkel placing mushrooms, improved circumstance recognition for the mushroom placement, reduced range for placement
Removed Glue/Super Glue, not much use, could possibly break stuff with balance regarding durability and such for tools or armor for other mods and for my
own, note to self: find another way to use sap in a recipe for something
Finished up the Overlord Core's model and textures, may add two more "low health" textures for it
Fixed a few offset issues with the core's model
Added datawatchers to the Overlord Core, I'm going to add one more attack that makes it pick up it's target and drop it from a high place, draining energy
from them while doing so
Deprecated the texture string for resolutions that the mod uses, 1.8 doesn't use these anyway, but there's way too many extraneous textures so I'll remove
all of the ones that aren't used (such as the higher resolution versions)

2.40.1984 <188> (February 8, 2015)
Added "drop" attack to the Overlord Core, it now picks up players and damages them while healing itself slowly, it can be hit in this phase regardless of if
divinity is active, if it isn't active then it goes straight into hover mode and fires mortors, otherwise it becomes vulnerable like normal
Also made it more aggressive and go towards a smaller y region, it now doesn't target any players while it is "vulnerable"
Added transparency to the Damaged Core texture so that it renders the dark portions partially invisible when it is vulnerable
Added Luminescence to the Overlord Core, modified some particle effects for it
Added Replaceable block list to the overlord core that other mobs should use to know if luminescence can be placed in a certain spot
Added animations to the Overlord Core's model, at this point, it is pretty much done so I'll prep for a release with this, going to do textures for the
Overlord set and then probably try to add the armor models for them and then release
Added Overlord armor textures, added new tool material for the "awakened" tools in the first expansion, the silent hellraiser will also use this and
will have a special "limited" lifespan ability, in other words, it'll have unbreakable on it, but it'll lose durability while in the user's hands, requiring
repair for continued use, it'll be repaired with the ascendent energy or whatever I decide to use as an upgrade material
Hiding the other two overlord forms while I prep for a release
Added the Overlord Core's model to it's statue
Added the damaged Overlord armor textures
Ensure that any item that overrides whether it has an effect to get the glow ensures that the render pass is 0 to avoid opengl blending issues
Darkened the mercury armor's textures, only rendered armor texture was changed to be less pink and more red
Moved Silent Hellraiser to it's own class instead of using an anonymous class for it
Finishing up adding weapon lores to the lore helper
Modified Harmony Bell to have 0 attack damage, it's enchantments now actually do something since I was able to allow it to actually damage things due to this
Experimented with creating a lores text file that could be edited by the user for each weapon to add custom lores, initial issues involve reading the file
correctly but that's mostly due to inexperience with it
Fixed rendering of blocks in potion effect indicators
Prep for updating Morph with the new package names, as well as the new entities
Added missing localizations to lang file
Added extra space in between a weapon's doomsday and the attack damage/enchantments in the description
Added Sentinel's lore and enchantments, it has normally impossible enchantment combinations (in survival without some enchanting mod)

2.40.2012 <189> (February 14, 2015)
This should be the last group of updates before a new release
Added more of the weapon lores (this is taking a long time to do, omg)
Cut some lore from the Celestial Aegis because it has so much
Attempting to fix a bug where if a lore rarity is set for a weapon/armor that doesn't have lore of that rarity (better than common), it just returns the default null lore
This should allow me to have weapons that only have rarities above a certain rarity, like the Sentinel and Overlord Armor being always highest rarity tier
Converted DoomsdayManager to use UUIDs rather than player names
Fixed some issues with this conversion, added player field to the doomsday effect to allow for easier access to it
Converted Dragon Fang's Enchantment tier to have Slay instead of Rune Break
Added more lore for the Sentinel, changed the enchantment tiers for the Titan, it now has consume instead of knockback
Modified Splinter's enchantment tiers to have consume instead of rune break and to have higher levels of knockback
Modified Mourning Star to not have unbreaking in it's enchantment tiers
Removed unbreaking from Tungsten Jack's enchantment tiers
Added Celestial Jack's enchantment tiers, it will not have efficiency at all in it's tiers but will have combustion on a lower tier than the tungsten variant, it gains bioluminescence
at the highest tier, it will have all 4 levels worth of lore and enchantment tiers
Converted Celestial/Tungsten Jack to use anonymous classes since their classes were empty anyway, anonymous classes aren't required but I don't want there to be any complications differentiating
them between each other and the normal jack
Increased the amount of text per line available in the description splitter for lores, the last line has extra available but will still cut off at a certain amount
Updated the code in TragicArmor to match the other weapons and items, completely forgot about doing that
Fixed debug messages in DoomsdayManager to refer to the UUIDs correctly, in the future I need to change this to get the username from the UUID
Made it so that all armor abilities require the full set to be on in order to have them active, this excludes the Overlord extra health modifiers
Modified LoreEntry to allow for different enchantments for armor sets (each piece of armor has it's own separate tier), modified TragicArmor to use that
Fixed initial issues with the list I use for the armor enchantments
Hunter Armor now prioritizes projectile protection and agility as the main component of their enchantment tiers
Fixed some bugs with armor textures, fixed small bug with Dark Armor not removing Fear immediately, fixed bug with Light Armor not immediately extinguishing burning players or removing blindness
Modified enchantment tiers of the Light Armor, different pieces have different values for each enchantment, even if they share the same enchants
Finished all of the lore, Overlord armor uses lore that quotes cyberpunk themed anime, but the majority of the quotes are from ghost in the shell
As with the Sentinel, Overlord Armor can only have epic rarity
Increased the influence of Elasticity enchantment
Fix projectile offset for creative projectile items
Fixed right-click ability of the Withering Axe, it now fires Wither Skulls properly
Modified Splinter's right-click ability to only use Doom when there are actually entities nearby for it to manipulate
Upon initial testing on a server environment, there was an issue with the attribute modifiers in the amulet recipes, due to this the amulet modifier static
method was simplified
Fixed game crash with Firestorm Doomsday, updated Fire Rain to only fire small fireballs (forgot to do that previously)
Added Digital Sea localizations
Testing a built version of the mod now, disabled debugging, bumped version number
Fixed Stin, Generator items and Overlord Mortor textures

2.41.2059 <190> (February 21, 2015) [Working on the Overlord Combat form]
Added transformation ticks to the Overlord Core, this is to prep for adding the first two forms (which are gonna take a while to create, again)
Added transformation animation to the Core, particles ftw lol
Fixed typo in repairing for tools that used the wrong material for the tungsten jack
Removed unused Tungsten toolmaterial
Allow configuration of respawning in the Collision, change spawn point check
Refactored all textures and texture paths that used the _lowRes suffix, removed unused textures from the assets directories, removed external files from
build path (techne files, gimp project files)
Removed unused saplings from TragicSapling
Fixed bug with Bleached Sapling using the old tree generator
Fixed some bugs with the newer Bleached Tree generator, they should now generate more properly
Started work on the Overlord Combat form, which will basically be like a suped up version of one of the normal bosses
Added Leap attack to the Combat form, it jumps up high and when it lands knocks all nearby entities far away from it
Changed how the Dimensional Anomaly applies it's Divinity effect to nearby entities, fixed intial issues with spawning it from the Combat form (such derps, wow)
Added an anomaly aggregate (unstable) phase to the Combat form, this will be the only opportunity the player will get to retaliate against the Combat form
Added Hacked effect application when the Combat form does it's leap attack
Added a buffer for the unstable phase of the Combat form to ensure it doesn't do it immediately after finishing one, reduced amount of time it stays in it's
unstable phase (Iron Golems could kill it relatively easily in that form)
Made it so that when an Anomaly applies Divinity to anything, it dies, rather than only dying when players are in it, this should prevent ppl from using
passive creatures or golems to do the heavy lifting (though that still is entirely possible, at least on the combat and cocoon forms)
Added hurt time and started work on the charging attack that it borrows from the Stin
Modified attack selector to attack all nearby living entities that it can see, that aren't synapse creatures
Allow Combat form to change targets when hit (so that it doesnt focus on one target while it's being attacked by others)
Added an AoE to it's normal attack, which will be like a slam attack
Ensure the aggregate doesn't increment whenever the Combat form is in it's unstable phase
Added a grapple laser attack, reduced chance for it to switch targets when hit by a non-target
Modified entity selector that the combat form uses to determine what to attack to allow for other entities to use it
Added reflection phase for the Combat form, it deflects all incoming damage as armor piercing (at a reduced rate) and attempts to maintain it's current
y level with barrier blocks, this phase should only activate while it's in the air
Ensure that none of the Overlord forms allow potion effects to be added to them
Added Mortor attack to the reflection phase of the Combat form, this only occurs if it is a certain distance away from it's target
Added more mortor fire to the Core form when it is vulnerable, it fires while it is fleeing
Improved parameters for the Overlord Mortors to find targets, added variable to determine whether or not they sometimes generate anomalies
I need to add the supplementary mobs to finish up it's AI (and I need to convert it's variables to datawatchers), then I need to work on it's model/rendering
Started work on the Hunter
Added config options for the harvester, hunter and seeker
Created the Hunter's AI, it acts as a more aggressive Plague mob, swarming it's target like an angered wasp
Fixed bug with the Combat form attacking while charging, added Hunter spawns while it is in Reflection mode and when it's health is lower in unstable mode
Moved mortor fire in reflection mode to when it's firing it's grapple beam, but only when it's health is lower
Fixed bug with spawning too many entities during the Combat form's reflection form, this pushed it in random directions (which admittedly looked cool) but also created a
huge amount of lag
Added Hunter to the Synapse's normal spawns, fixed nano swarm's config spawns never being added to it
Starting work on the Lockbot now
Made it so that they attach a "lock" on you if you get near them, and if you go outside of that range you get the Leadfoot effect inflicted on you as well
as a huge speed debuff
Added Lockbot to the Synapse spawns, it has the lowest chance to spawn out of all the synapse entities (as it's the most annoying)
Added Harvester entity, it moves in singular directions until it can't move anymore (or until a random amount of time passes) then it changes directions,
it basically is completely neutral but has passive effects to nearby mobs and randomly may spawn in Nano Swarms
Fixed typo in Mob Rush challenge (game crash fix)
Added Harvester to Synapse spawns
Converted Combat form to use datawatchers, added hasLeaped to nbt tags
Added some particle effects to the Combat form, need to start working on it's model since that is what took the longest with the Core form
Added Corrupted Essence and Corrupted Eye items in order to craft the Overlord Armor set (and for future stuff)
Removed the Spore item and set all things that used it to the projectile, in other words, the item was basically converted to it's projectile form
Added recipes for the Overlord Armor set and for the Corrupted Essence
Removed Mortor attack from the Combat form, added a buffer to it's reflection phase so that it doesn't go back into it repeatedly
Added corrupted egg and added recipe for it, need to add functionality to it

2.41.2094 <191> (March 9, 2015)
Added Nano Bots, added them to the Overlord Armor recipes, added a celled block recipe that uses them
Added Synapse Core recipe that uses one Synapse crystal and 8 nano bots
Added functionality to Synapse Core block, it can now be used to summon another Overlord (only Combat form to Core for now, until the Cocoon form is done)
It'll also be used as the base for the Ascendent Stone recipe when that is implemented instead of an Obsidian Orb
Instead of having the Overlord spawn in when you get to the Synapse, I'm going to make the player instead craft a Synapse Core and summon one in themselves,
since you can get the things for it by killing mobs (Synapse Crystals are from the Aegar, but it'll be a rare drop for most Synapse mobs)
Added drops for all of the current Synapse mobs, all of them can drop nano bots but each one (except for the Nano Swarm) have other additional drops
Added textures for the new items, Nano Bots and Corrupted Egg
Added fuctionality to Corrupted Egg, uses a modified version of the spawn egg
Fixed sky renderers for the Dimensions, this improved memory use in the Synapse greatly
Changed Lock entity to apply slowness X intead of using an attribute modifier, it's less work and it makes sure that after the lock is gone that the effect
doesn't stay without using an update event
Modified Lock constructor some
Added transformation ticks to the Combat form, going to set up some particle effects for that but I really need to start on all of the new entity models
Added some missing attribute modifiers from the config, this was just a derp
Increased range in which an anomaly can give it's Divinity effect, since the Overlord instance requires you to do this fairly quickly to attack it's a
bit annoying in it's current state to get Divinity during the fight since you need to stand right on it to get the effect
Decreased rate in which the Core form heals, fixed bug that made it almost not move if moving through terrain and vulnerable at the same time (resulting
in an easy kill)
Added a celled block platform that generates when the Core form dies, to make sure none of the drops fall into the void (if it's killed at a low or high
spot it may not generate the platform)
Fixed small bugs with Corrupted radiation (corruption affecting entities near a corrupted one)
Converted Corruption handler to use UUIDs instead of names
Added model for the Harvester, added directional rotation for when it moves/changes directions, added rotator animation, added small panel animation for
when it spawns a nano swarm
Removed Pirah from the Collision spawns, modified Stins to only spawn in Tainted biomes
Added Skultar spawn to Decaying biomes
Added Kragul to Ashen biome spawns
Added particle effect to Harvester, improved it's motion
Slight fix to Vox Stellarum rotation
Reduced distance Pumpkinheads will wander from their home pumpkin (if they have one), this will reduce the chance of seeing random pumpkins underground with
no Pumpkinhead near them
Added localizations of new entity names and new items
Added model for the Hunter, added animations, it has no special animation other than it's normal living one
Hunter can now attack mobs other than players
Fixed Apis's attack/hurt animations, updated Apis texture to not be as flat looking
Added model for Lockbot, using the same model scaled down for the lock, it has no animations as it doesn't move, it acts as a sentry
Allow the lockbot to damage non-player entities that it is near
Added textures for the Lockbot, Lock, Hunter and Harvester
Fixed improper meta checking for generator items, fixed spike generator metadata
Fixed bug with throwable entities not staying on the block they land on
Added small particle effect when a Harvester releases a Nano Swarm
Fixed amulet modifiers not being applied while in amulet inventory and not in hand, fixed bug with them never being removed after being applied

2.41.2118 <192> (March 15, 2015)
Ensure that the dimension is the Synapse when summoning the Overlord with a Core, summon the Overlord with Transformation active
Set up the Combat form's transformation phase properly
Added error handling for retrieving a challenge for a fresh challenge scroll
Changed chances of drops on harder difficulties for Challenges, making the better items more common
Added more null checks for Challenges
Fixed Titan weapon model texture
Modified WorldGen for various things in the Collision, altered Isle generation to use a modified version of the inverted spike gen, this makes the isles
look way better and they also generate with less lag
Added altered IsleGen to the Celestial Temple schematic, it hangs for a second or so but ultimately looks way better and is worth the extra load time
Added small animated numbers that indicate your difference in Doom
Increased range of incrementation for Doom when attacking or being attacked, it can now give you up to 6 Doom for a massive hit taken or done, but lower
damage has an even lower chance to regenerate Doom
Ensure that Bosses that are immune to normal damage still get removed when they fall into the void or get hit too high up
Added a new method for 1.8 textures
Fixed derp up with setting Dimension IDs in the config, blah
Fixed metadata derp with mob drops for Spores
Allow Stin to attack while galloping
Started work on the Overlord Cocoon form while I'm creating the model for the Combat form, I also need to make the Seeker entities as that is a key part
of the Cocoon form's AI
Allow Core form to target non-player non-synapse living entities
Improved Core AI to allow for more target variety on attacks, only allow Core to hover/fire mortors if within 32 blocks of visible target so that it doesn't heal
outside of player render view/range
Fixed render of Overlord Core
Updated Statue textures to make them look better and keep them up to date with my other updated textures
Changed sizes of various statues to keep them more consistent with their mob's actual size compared to the other statues
Fixed texture bug with Empariah statue
Fixed Apis moving while doing it's Stomp attack, improved it's animations for being hurt and attacking, added new hurt datawatcher to it
Added chat message to players explaining why a Boss that is spawned disappears immediately

2.41.2140 <193> (March 20, 2015)
Fixed statue interaction, blaze powder is the only thing that can reset a statue's texture now, previously any other item would do it and be removed but
now it ensures that blaze powder is the only thing that works, this is more to prevent ppl from losing important items than forcing them to use blaze powder
to reset the texture, made it so that Synapse Crystals are required to animate it
Moved registration of Synapse Crystal higher up to make it easier to find in the Creative tab
Improved rendering of statues, they can now be animated and have a different texture at the same time, added Leaf texture to replace Red Mercury
Added nbt tag to statue itemstack to ensure they remember that they were animated, added new textures to localization
Added Seeker entity, gave it it's basic AI, it kills when it sees an entity for 300 ticks, which is about 15 seconds, the player (if they have a weapon that
does more than 25 damage) should be able to kill them if they bum rush it right when it sees them, otherwise they'll need to do some hide and seek with it
until they kill it
Added ability for it to "spot" targets for nearby synapse mobs
Make Cocoon immune to projectile attacks
Allow Seekers to relocate themselves if they are not in a good position, this should only be done on initial spawn and should not be done any other time
Added basic stuff to the Cocoon form's AI, fixed some initial phase change bugs, fixed some health setting bugs
Improved Seekers AI to allow for them to automatically relocate to a more valid location, added relocation counter in the case that a Seeker teleports too many times
and can't find a suitable position, it now teleports to it's owner or gets set dead if it has none
Each form of the Overlord has Luxury drops, this may get changed by release but I'll see for now if it's that big of a deal
Fixed nbt tags of the Overlord forms, they were reversed (reading instead of writing)
Added nbt tags to the Cocoon form and to the Seekers, also to the Harvester
Continuing work on the Combat form's model, the Cocoon form should be really easy to do, but I may split it into fourths to make the transformation animation
of the Combat form make more sense
Improved Time Amulet's effectiveness
Created new entity AI that makes an entity keep it's gaze focused on it's target, this will be used for Bosses and the Seeker entity
Did some work on the Aegar Battletower, it'll probably be renamed Corrupted Spire since it uses darker blocks from the Collision biomes
Created a new flower called the Pure Aeris, which is a crystal-like semi-transparent flower, but if placed in the Collision it'll become corrupted and
will generate the spire (if at a low enough y level), this has a placeholder currently and needs it's own class and tile entity for intended function
Added ability to the Sword of Justice to kill all nearby entities, it requires the player to be an operator on servers though to do so

2.42.2178 <194> (March 25, 2015) [Lot of new blocks and new biome sets added]
Ensure that players that are dead do not continue using their Doomsdays that they have active, also change debug message to convert player uuids to their
username
Fixed Doom Consumes not properly refilling Doom on use (they still increased Max Doom fine), this is due to a weird math bug, assumingly with Java 8
Reduced radius that Reach affects entities that you attack, in other words, made it fit closer with vanilla so that you actually need to target entity's bounding boxes
in order to hit them, fixed offset bug as well
Added minor death animation for the Overlord Core, uses a modified version of the Ender Dragon's (like everything else involved with the Core)
Added offsets to the death animation of the Core
Allow Convergence to remove Cooldown
Removed Synapse Biome decorator, since I forgot to do so before, deleted it completely in favor of making the player summon the Overlord themselves
Fixed spawning the wrong form with the Synapse Core in the Synapse, added message to all nearby players saying if the summoning attempt is in the wrong dimesion
Fixed Disorientation (again) and added some random sound effects to Fear since otherwise it doesn't really do much to players
Did some improvements to rendering of certain overlays for effects
Improved death animation of the Overlord Core some
Adding new blocks for new biomes now, added Geyser blocks, added Molten rocks and added Hallowed Grass
The Geyser block can push entities up that walk on it, but don't do it constantly, they also don't launch the entity too high but you will take fall damage
from it
Added a steam vent block, it works similarly to the Geyser except it always has steam coming out of it
Added String Light and Fragile Light, Fragile Light disappears when entities get near it but reappear later on
Adding the Hallowed biome set since I have the most blocks done for that, added String Light and Fragile/Normal Light gen as well
Added a modified Hallow Tree Generation, added Leaf trim for the trees, these generate on top of the leaves
Added the Scorched biome set since I had a lot of blocks finished for it, it'll only have a couple biomes but they'll each have lots of worldgen
Added Geyser WorldGen and increased lava lake generation in the Scorched biomes, particularly the valley
Added Steam Vent WorldGen
Added config option to disable non-Dimension spawns for my mobs, since this most likely won't be used much (if at all), it's only going to be a blanket
option for all of the mobs, like the Boss ones
Modified how the biome list for the Collision is stored and used, this will probably break some stuff, removed sets from the biome setup class since they
weren't used much and aren't necessary since all biomes in a set extend one class each
Reorganized WorldGen so that inverted spikes generate after everything else, since they are destructive, fixed Steam Vent and Geyser WorldGen
Added Jabba, Wisp and Kitsunakuma to the Scorched biome spawns
Added new Erkel texture for Hallowed biomes and added Hallowed Sapling texture
Added Apis to the Hallowed biome spawns
Added new blocks and biomes to localizations
Working on directed lightning currently, it'll be a more localized version of vanilla lightning
Currently have it working to reduce sound but the rendering isn't quite working out how I want it to, unfortunately this will probably require some geometry
and some calculations that I don't know how to do yet, but I'll look over some other renders and try to modify the code for it
Changed some things that used Vanilla lightning bolts to use my new directed lightning, since it has quieter sounds anyway
Made it so that directed lightning doesn't damage it's user, it also doesn't light up the sky like normal lightning
Reduced height in which string lights start generating, reduced amount of pure/fragile light that generates as well
Reduced amount of isles that generate in Tainted Isles biomes, this is to stop it from hanging as much when generating them
Modified crafting trees a bit, Light Particles are downgraded to a normal mob drop, Pure Light is added as a Boss drop for the Apis
This was done for balancing as well as for giving newer mobs a drop without creating a new item branch
Added recipes to allow for conversion from pure versions to their particle counterparts, allow creation of nether stars with pure light and emeralds
Added Seeker model and texture, also added particle effects for it's gaze attack, updated Seeker bounding box to fit the model better
Added config option to change the damage cap on Bosses
Fixed Challenges that required Mini-Boss kills or finding
Did a minor fix to Claymation's health tracking
Added recipe for creating the Corrupted Spire structure seed, fixed Aeris item textures to fit the block textures

2.42.2205 <195> (March 31, 2015)
Added Wicked Vines and two new types of Gas, these won't be temporary Gases though like the others, they'll be persistant worldgen features
Reworked some higher level item tiers again, Ectoplasm is now more prominent as a crafting component
Fixed crafting recipe of an Apis statue, used it's previous boss drop on accident
Allow Explosive Gas to create an explosive chain, add Wicked Vine texture
Added Toxic Sludge, a new Quicksand variant for the Corroded biomes
Finishing up the Overlord Combat form's model, then I'm going to switch over to using Tabula instead of Techne since it is more feature-robust (and updated
for newer MC versions)
Added allowPvP option to the config, defaults to true, this only affects doomsdays and weapons affecting other players since other things like enchantments
may be used by hostile mobs that wear armor and there's no way to tell that from just the enchantment class
Added particle spawn message, there may be a vanilla one but I prefer using the net system that I have anyway, this should allow for more flexibility with things
like using particles on attack targets without having to save the target in a datawatcher
Added Corroded biome set, added more biomes to spawn biomes (at least one from each set, up to two from ones with more than 3 variants)
Due to the increase in amount of biomes, biome sizes were increased, added void pit gen to the Fallout variant
Added Wicked vine generation, reduced size of tainted spike generation to account for the increased biome sizes
Fixed variant of the Obsidian Cavern that generated nothing in it, it's supposed to have a single difficult to get chest
Removed the structure seeds for the Obsidian Cavern presets, it'll only have the randomized one now
Finished up the Combat form model, I wanted to add more detailing to it, but it has around 180 parts already
Added Amulet repair from a tough kill, repair amount is based on amulet level and if the amulet is a normal amulet or not
Allow Mega Cryse to be one shot with the Sword and Bow of Justice
Added new statues for the Overlord's other two forms since there was so much work put into their models, the player can switch between them with Overlord Essence
but they won't maintain their texture/animation (I'm not making a custom recipe type just for this)
Added Bone Marrow to the Bone block conversion recipe from Deathly Hallows
Fix NPE with Reach when attacking when it is disabled
Fix game crash caused by using mobsOnly mode (AIOOB exception from recent additions to the config)
Modified mobsOnly mode to never register most of the blocks & items, previously I'd avoid this but if someone is using this option, they probably wouldn't
care about having their blocks or items saved anyway
Fixed NPE when mobsOnly mode is enabled for certain entities (ones that use Luminescence mostly)
Added ability for Summon Blocks to be activated via redstone, added NPE protection in that case
Fixed NPE from projectiles when mobsOnly mode is enabled
Modified Overlord Core to generate an obsidian platform instead of a Celled block one in the case of mobsOnly mode being enabled
Removed some unnecessary loops from the config, this should speed up loading some
Going through the configuration file and ensuring that each option is set up properly or used

2.43.2244 <196> (April 8, 2015) [Structure generation rewritten]
Updated the Combat form's model, setting up all of the child parts
Fixed initial issues with the Combat form's model (typoed offsets, typoes in child parts)
Fixed Combat form's rotation (overriden rotateCorpse apparently affects that)
Fixed Combat form using certain abilities in situations that are unfit (trying to use charge attack while in water, etc.)
Fixed particle offsets for certain abilities of the Combat form (due to change in it's hitbox from the one I was testing on)
Added render effect that the Apis uses for reflection to the Combat form
Added animations for the Combat form, still need a texture
Added textures for the Combat and Cocoon form's statues
Fix Hacked being removed leaving the player with no movement input option (the player can't move unless they relog or die)
Added worldgen for the explosive/radiated gas as well as for the sludge
Updating structures and structure schematics currently, this will take up more classes but will not look as complex as the previous generation, it'll
use static structures with instanced schematics
Removed variant towers from the Structure seeds, since they are all about the same anyway, they will now be randomized when spawned from the structure
seeds
Greatly reduced the amount of code inside the Structure seed class, there is still special casing for the Obsidian Caverns, which I'll hopefully work out
while I finish rewriting the class
Removed special casing from generating a structure via structure seed, however, I still need to add the rest of the structures to the structure list
Experimenting with implementing matrices for the schematics, this would allow me to rotate them for a little variance however, things like stairs would
require a bit more work to place correctly with meta values (this could be done in the rotate method though, checking if the blockpreset is an instanceof
stairs)
Added more block types to the "safe" spawn blocks
Working on fixing a bug where Toxic Sludge generates with normal Quicksand for some reason
Made the Aeris instance a bit more difficult, you have to defend it from various mobs in the Collision (mostly Tragic Nekos, since they are most destructive)
while it is corrupting, added chat messages to notify the player of the Aeris's current status
Allow the Aeris to destroy blocks around it in order to prevent the instance from being made easier by blocking possible spawns
Reduced chance for Tragic Neko to drop explosives on death
Fixed localizations of changed items/blocks
Added localizations of Corroded biomes
Fixed Quicksand not properly dropping as a falling block
More work done on structures and schematics, some changes are needed for the multi-part schematics (Kitsune Den, Obsidian Cavern, etc.)
Added Wicked Vine generation to the Corroded biomes, also setup their variation in their worldgen aspects, increased root height of the Corroded Heights
biome since it wasn't generating very plateau-like
Updated two more of the schematics/structures, commented out all of the matrix stuff so that it doesn't get in the way 
Fixed initial bug where a tower would always generate based off of biome when generated with a structure seed
Made it so that if multiple structures can generate in a chosen spot, if one fails due to biome/config restriction another may attempt to generate there
Updated Kitsune Den, it can now generate with multiple dens as it's variants instead of them being randomized each time, now you can pick how many dens
but that option won't actually be usable because I don't want there to be too many structure seeds
Added variants for the Apis and Celestial Temple, these just affect if there are more than one summon blocks generated, added variant size for tower
Since the second variant part of the Obsidian Cavern now longer needs to be able to be preset it is now randomized when the structure is generating
Fixed possible bug with using the wrong height value from the schematic
Added Time Altar to structures, it uses it's variance for determining what color of star crystal generates in it, also made it circular instead of spherical
to reduce load time of it, also makes it less bulky
Fixed intial bugs with not overriding the generation method properly to actually generate the schematic
Fixed more initial worldgen bugs, with things like not checking if the height was a valid amount to start generating and if the starting block was correct to
start a surface structure
Fixed another worldgen bug, had the wrong starting coordinates set up
Reduced spawn rate of Aeris using a configurable value
Fixed another worldgen bug with surface structures generating underground in caves
Added cap on FlowerWorldGen to prevent it from causing hangs on worldgen
Added another cap on worldgen for structures to prevent them trying to generate above the world limit
Allowed Death Circle to generate in Scorched biomes
Fixed Molten Netherrack not doing the proper block pick in creative mode, reverted change to it that made it drop as lava rocks

2.43.2285 <197> (April 9, 2015)
Added a new chest type, it will require mob kills near it to collect souls, this'll generate in a small standalone structure in the Collision, it'll
have similar generation to the Kitsune Den, except much smaller of course
It basically uses a retextured chest as it's model but this should be fine
Added Soul Tomb structure for the soul chest, it won't generate with spawners but it will generate with good items inside, it's very difficult to mine and
has very high explosive resistance so killing mobs near it should be the best option (may make it unbreakable until it has enough souls)
Added soul tomb rarity to config, removed yeti ravine since it'll probably not be added anytime soon
Added variants to the Soul Tomb that just change the block it's made out of, added icon for the soul chest to replace the vanilla rendered one
Added Aegar summon block along with it's texture
Fixed recipe for the Corrupted Spire struture seed
Typing up the Corrupted Spire schematic currently, it uses a LOT of space and is the largest structure I've ever made (ironic since the Soul Tomb that
I added before was one of the smallest structures I've ever made)
Added utility methods for adding text to signs and specifying a mob for a spawner in the structure superclass
Finished up the Corrupted Spire, it doesn't generate completely uniform (the outer blocks don't quite generate properly for each floor type) but that
doesn't really matter, the tower generates as it should and is actually really tough to do, I decided to put it to 20 floors because there is a lot of
lag while generating it and also because it is actually very difficult to get through
Changed the Molten Rock textures, they are now less saturated and don't have as much contrast
Removed some imports from the main class, this makes it look a bit messier but that's fine
Increased the cap some worldgens had in the config
Fixed bug with distance challenge scroll not properly counting negative coordinates
Allow certain food items to be potion ingredients, in modded this isn't that big of a feature but still it's cool to have, if I figure out how to do the bitwise flags
I'll maybe change some of them to my mod's potion effects
Added Overlord Cocoon model and death animation, increased hitbox size
Improved ability for Seekers to teleport to a safe location
Fixed Overlord Core platform being placed on the client and server side
Fixed Dark Lightning not using Directed Lightning, the Enyvil still uses it when it does it's thunderstorm attack
Added Overlord Cocoon/Combat form textures, fixed minor offset with one of the circuits in the Combat form model
Updated Synapse entity egg textures
Adding new blocks for the new frozen biomes, moved some gas variants into their own classes rather than keeping them anonymous
Consolidated Vine WorldGen classes since they use the same worldgen anyway, removed extra vine worldgen that corroded biomes used
Added configurability of biome weights for my biomes, added Frozen biomes to the dimension
If all biome weights are set to 0, then the Dimension is disabled
Added Ice spike generaton to the Frozen biomes, uses my custom spike generation, not the vanilla one
Added ice spike blocks, these are a sort of trap block
Added Snow Golem spawns to Frozen biomes
Added small Pits that generate with hazardous blocks at the bottom, these will generate in each of the new biomes, uses a modified version of the void pit generator
Fixed Ragr spawning
Reduced chance for Soul Tombs, Celestial Temples and Pits to generate
Added Frozen texture to Erkel, updated Wisp to spawn snow particles when in Frozen biomes
Added Crystal biome, added Crystal block, changed worldgen to have a 5 in 1000 chance to generate a crystal biome (if config is left unchanged)
Made moss not able to be climbed up like a ladder
Added Frozen biomes as valid spot for ice towers to generate
Added spike generation to crystal biome
Added Archangel, no model/render yet until I get it's AI down, it will use a heavily modified version of the Ghast's AI, using hovering from the Overlord
Core's AI and laser fire from the Seeker's AI
Added ability to use any of the Jacks as hoes, this should've been added before but I guess I forgot about it
Added hover buffer and light value cap to the Archangel's light ray attack, need to add it's model and rendering now
Adding the Ire, it will use static variables to have a true hive-mind AI
The Ire's tick will be controlled by a server update event, I'll use this event for other things in the future (possibly) that require server tick updates
Added Archangel Feathers and the Wings of Liberation from the first version of the mod, it uses the Flight abilities from the Flight potion effect but doesn't
actually give you Flight (due to complications involved in doing that per tick), I'll eventually add a sort of phantom item that lets you move through walls
and also fly through them, it'll probably involve the Wings of Liberation in the recipe along with Ectoplasm and one other drop (either a new drop or an old
underused one)
Added recipe for the Wings of Liberation that uses a couple of the new drops in addition to a Dragon Egg
Added special check for Corrupted Spire to ensure that it gets generated in the Collision

2.43.2325 <198> (April 14, 2015)
Added Fusea, it drops redstone, gunpowder and unstable isotopes, it explodes when attacked or attacking something losing one of it's shells in the process until
it has no shells left and dies
Added TNT recipes for Unstable Isotopes, one uses gunpowder and yields 8, the other uses lunar powder and yields 16
Fixed bug where Fusea would not have any drops on death
Added Volatile Fusea, a larger version that moves faster the less shells it has, it has a chance to drop redstone blocks and a greater chance to drop unstable isotopes
Volatile Fusea is a mini-boss version of the Fusea, in case that wasn't obvious
Added ability for Fusea to heal when struck by lightning, added ability for Volatile Fusea to do random damaging effects when near certain blocks
Prioritize being near energy blocks doing it's effect than being near fire, because otherwise the first lightning it summons will immediately change it
into fireball mode and that'll be basically perpetual until it wanders away
Fixed Dragon Fang model offsets and improved Reaper Scythe model/texture
Added Sentinel, Hellraiser and Neko Launcher models
Fixed missle firing out of the player's face, it now fires close to where the rocket should be (in their crotch area lol)
Improved Titan model, made it look a bit lessy bulky and made it's texture have a bit more contrast
Added armor model for Dark armor, it takes so long to do this, my god
Added Stalagmite and cracked permafrost gen for the Frozen biomes
Reduced amount of grass that generates in Frozen biomes, particularly in Tundras
Added armor model for Light armor, it uses a modified version of the Dark Armor (so does the item textures so this fits anyway)
Removed references to Circuit Golem from config, originally I planned it as a new golem type (helpful golem for the player to spawn in) but I ended up
rolling it's planned AI into the Aegar and it's spawning method into the Overlord
Added new item, weapon and Doomsday, it is meant to act as another "fun" type of weapon to go along with the Neko Launcher as well as a new item for other
recipes
Removed special check for the Corrupted Spire to be generated in the Collision, it's no longer necessary to have this as a restriction (and it's probably going
to be less laggy having the players able to spawn it in the overworld)
Added checks for null structures and for structures having enough vertical space to fully generate
Fixed height value for Obsidian Caverns
Added Ire Node as a drop for the Ire, also added a few recipes involving it
Made the Soul Tomb a bit more bulkier, so that is has more of a tomb feeling instead of an open cradle look
Added armor model for the Overlord armor
Added a safeguard to the Cocoon to prevent it from being spawned in too trapping of an area, I think it'd be a cool ability to prevent the player from placing blocks
while near it, but mostly this is to ensure that there is enough space to spawn in the Seekers
Added more armor types to randomly apply on Vanilla mobs (zombies, skeletons) when they spawn
Added model with basic texture for the Fusea and Volatile Fusea, fixed renders for them both (they share a render)
Added model and texture for the Archangel, added new render class for simple mobs that have transparency
Added Ranmas with basic AI, it is immune to all damage except from other Ranmas or from colliding with things at high speed
Added Dark Forest biomes, added Darkwood and Dark Leaves, added Dark Vines, added Dark Tree generation, added Dark Grass, added Dark Gas
Added new config option to set the biome sizes, this is heavily restricted due to the huge amount of lag that could occur if set too high
Added model for Ranmas, it'll use the Crystal block for it's texture
Fixed item use duration for Dimensional Keys, it now properly takes 3 seconds on use when not in Creative
Adjusted biome heights and grass/tree generation per chunk for the Dark Forest biomes, fixed generation error with them
Added tall grass variant for Dark Forest biomes
Added Parasmite mob for the Dark Forest biomes, it will attach to any mob near it and give it a strength buff, but it will damage them once per tick while attached
The Parasmite will reuse the Hunter model, since it is how I was gonna make it look anyway, it'll use it's own texture of course
Added Abomination and Empariah to the Frozen biome spawns
Added Dark Gas generation via the decorator inside of the BiomeGen class
Added Ranmas and Parasmite to the drop helper, Ranmas currently doesn't drop anything useful, but may in the future drop something rare like Ascendent Shards
Fixed Erkels poisoning entities that aren't close to them, regardless of if the damage was projectile
Fixed Soul Tomb not properly clearing enough air space when generating

2.43.2375 <199> (April 20, 2015)
Fixed armor models not allowing the server to load, they are now stored in the client proxy
Fixed Soul Chest causing a crash on the server-side (accidentally used render bounding box)
Fixed crash with Fusea, made Fusea immune to explosions
Adjusted biomes to allow them to generate down to y = 42
Added Drudge worldgen to the Dark Marshland
Reduced trees per chunk for Hallowed Prarie biomes, increased trees per chunk for Dark Forest Hills
Fixed armor models not "sneaking" with the player
Fixed Ranmas charging being affected by water/lava
Improved blast resistance of Frozen blocks because of the Ragr destroying them too easily
Reduced size of Geysers and improved generation logic for Boulders, Steam Vents as well as Geysers
Reduced amount of String lights and such that generate for Hallowed biomes
Increased amount of lava lakes that generate in Scorched biomes
Fixed WorldGen for dimensional flowers, it did a lot of unnecessary checks for my various block types so it never placed the flowers
Added more flower worldgen for my biomes, only certain types for specific biome sets though
Added Fire worldgen for Scorched biomes and made some blocks fire sources
Rearranged world generators to do destructive generators first
Fixed game crashes caused by Mob Statues
Added localized name for Dark Tall Grass
Fixed statue rendering again (stupid eclipse wasn't updating to the correct values so I screwed them up when I adjusted them the first time)
Added recipe for Dark Sand since I'm not sure if I'll ever add a sandy biome that will have it and adjusted recipe for Smooth Netherrack
Disabled DEBUG so that I can do an actual Survival test run (less lag that way)
Did some balancing for the mobs, made Psygote easier to fight, Harvester/Seekers no longer take an eternity to kill, Mega Cryse and Pumpkinhead
are slightly tougher to kill
Greatly reduced chance for Time Controller to spaz out
Increased default health of Kitsunakuma, increased armor of Polaris and Empariah
Added texture for Hunter's armor, completely forgot about doing that
Added NBT Tags for new mobs, removed unnecessary datawatcher from Fusea
Suppressed warning for Neko Wand's ore wand aspect (only a DEBUG thing)
Modified Ranmas to be allowed to be damaged by normal entities but only 1 damage will be done to it max
Experimented a bit with using a Lore json file for the weapon lores again, referred to the Morph mod in order to implement it in it's current state but
it's not going to be done in this release as too much testing is required for it
Fixed Hacked not taking effect due to fix for it, improved Flight and Wings of Liberation handling of it
Added lores for IreNet Particle Cannon, wasn't going to do this at first but may as well since I've done all this other stuff while testing
Send message to player on world join notifying them if the Flight potion effect is disabled, this will notify for each Dimension change but shouldn't
be too much of an annoyance
Added config option for Flight notify as well as for armor models
Fixed players being able to stand on statues, this is to prevent kicks from multiplayer environments
Added Ranmas animations, fixed them not properly being set, also fixed bug from previous fix that prevented it from actually charging
Fixed Overlord Cocoon taking extra damage while being hurt resistant
Changed Flight notify to get the client's config setting for it instead of the server's
Going through and making sure Challenges are working
Fixed Wither Kill challenge
Changed Wither Skull collection challenge to Red Sand since Skulls have a weird itemblock issue
Fixed Living Entities challenge, fixed biome challenges
Added lots of new challenges for the new content of the mod
Added more clear descriptions for Challenges, on completion tells you the completed challenge and the difficulty, in progress tells you location-specific
information now
Fixed id offsets for Challenges, added exceptions for if an ID is already in use, simplified Challenge constructors
Improved Reach targetting, it now works way more effectively using bounding boxes of blocks and interrupting the hit before it gets to an unsuspecting
target
Updated TileEntity names to avoid mixups with other mods that may have similarly named tile entities
Fixed recipes and drops for Spore, they were using Spirit Casts instead
Removed Sap item, it had a use before but since then it has become an obsolete item
Modified Vanilla drops (my additional drops), Witches now may drop various projectile items (Spirit Casts, Pumpkinbombs), Tragic Nekos may now
also drop their various projectiles
Made SkyRenderer's static and final on the client, this should vastly improve dimensional load times on the client side
Removed some debug spam
Working on improving FPS in the Synapse, reduced amount of Digital Sea generation
Removed some unnecessary targetting for some mobs, improved some mob's flight ability by checking to the ground below them rather than the highest block
in that particular column in the world, this might be moved to a WorldHelper method so that other things like Doomsdays can use it
Added Empariah Cave, since it's easier to add structures now, it generates in Frozen Tundra biomes with packed ice, added to config
Modified StructureWorldGen to give more weight to the horizon of the world, this allows more chances for surface Structures to generate
Fixed Ragr model offsets and animations, fixed Ragr leg animations
Fixed Sludge/Drudge generating as normal Quicksand, this was due to a bug in BlockFalling

2.43.2409 <200> (April 25, 2015)
Added/Changed/Removed sounds for Jabba species
Modified DropHelper to make it make more sense and fix Janna and possibly other variant drops
Added Plague sounds
Added Gragul/Kragul sounds
Experimented with Particles and registering icons outside of block/item classes, may update some potion icons later using this
Added Minotaur sounds, small fix to charge animation for it
Modified LoreHelper to allow for custom lores to be added via a json file, this is something I've wanted to do for a while so it's great that I've finally
been able to add it (even though I originally wanted to add all of the default lores to it as a base, that's way too much work for something that probably
won't get used by most people)
Modified EntityDropHelper and LoreHelper so that they do not have huge static initializers, this should speed up their load times and allow for better
response time for drops and lores
Removed time logger from DEBUG, it wasn't very useful anyway
Moved some WorldGen to the Chunk Provider of the Dimension, I'll work on moving the other worldgen to their biome decorators later
Reduced amount of Isles that generate in Tainted Isles, modified their general locations for gen and their sizes
Added variant field to my biomes, this is to keep track of variants within a set for biome decoration
Modified IsleGen to be a decoration for Tainted Isles exclusively, note to self: use chunk coords not block coords you derp
Added Inkling sounds, it has a pretty huge variety of sounds due to them being actual spoken words (which makes it easier to identify particular sounds).
Added a small variant to Inklings, Tortured Inklings, they only have one or no arms, they also make more aggressive sounds when killed (this is an aesthetic variant)
Added Ragr sounds, removed extraneous targetting from them, improved their jumping AI
Added Dimensional blocks to the Ragr's crushable blocks, it can now "pulverize" certain Dimensional block types to less resistant block types
Added Pumpkinhead sounds, added new texture for when it's not angry
Modified Pumpkinhead model to extend ModelBiped, it now has a riding animation and should also render hats from the Hats mod
Modified TragicNeko model to also extend ModelBiped, adding sounds for it next, fixed a lot of animation/model bugs with it
Added a lot of TragicNeko sounds, this is one of my favorite mobs
Added Sound Extrapolator item, for now it's Creative only unless I decide to add it to Survival with obscure ingredients, it uses reflection in order
to play entity sounds
Modified CustomSpikesWorldGen to take specifying values for it's generation, it is now used in multiple biome decorators with the specifications in place
Certain biome variants now have more varying degrees of spike generation
Rearranged some worldgen for the dimension
Increased generation size of Void Pits, improved the modified Spike generator, removed Snow Golems from the Frozen biomes they were spawning way too much
Modified Tough Leather recipe to only require one leather, this is to make early game a bit easier to survive (if you don't go the mining route)
Increased volume of most of the mob sounds, their actual sounds not volume in game
Stop mob sound from playing when spawned
Move WorldDependency to ChunkProvider, this is to prevent it from being recalculated every chunk (very small improvement)
Removed some unused code from EnchantmentEvents
Finished moving all WorldGen to biome specific decorators, consolidated some WorldGen
Modified some dimension specific generation to be more easily extendible and modifiable, moved these to biome decoration as well
Break compatibility with older Forge versions by removing deprecated method calls for repair materials for armor/materials, that version is extremely
outdated so this should only affect those who don't update their Forge when they should (which unfortunately is the majority of ppl)
Added mob group buffs, this was originally meant to be attribute modifiers but I think it'd be a bit annoying to do those so I just did potion effects
for particular groups on spawn, since my effects are configurable, there are placeholders for those in case they are disabled

2.43.2442 <201> (May 4, 2015) [May the 4th be with you.]
Fixed Crystal biome generating with default blocks
Reduced a lot of hangs by reducing iterations for multiple worldgen types
Converted Corroded biome ashen cobble gen to use the rugged terrain gen since I think it fits what I want for it better
Removed sludge from base variants of corroded biomes, only fallout and runoff have sludge now, this is to create more specialization for that set as it is
currently pretty samey
Fixed vine gen for corroded biomes (the frequencies were inverted for variants)
Small fix for Underground structures generating above the surface of a deep biome
Removed a bunch of logger spam, enabled DEBUG
Fixed NekoNekoWand not targetting multipart entities
Allow non-player entities to attack multipart mobs
Modified StructureWorldGen to allow surface structures a greater chance to generate, previously it was pretty biased towards other structure types and
surface structures had a tiny chance to actually generate
Added respawn buffer for Enyvil's Dark Crystals, this is something I've been meaning to add since it regenerates them too quickly when they get destroyed
Reduced size of InvertedSpikes worldgen
Fixed Spore doing damage to Tox
Fixed multiple projectile entity issues, specifically with the Overlord mortor
Modified Overlord Core to use the movement system from the Archangel, it is heavily modified to fit with the Core's attack patterns but fixes the bug
wit the Core being rotated 180 degrees from what it should be
Fixed spawn coordinates not being used if set by Crying Obsidian in the dimensions, doesn't affect the Synapse or the End
Removed DEBUG mode and the time field from the main class
Made Fear work more effectively on non-player entities, fixed possible client-side crash from playing too many sound effects at the same time (client update bug)
Fixed rare visual glitch when one potion effect removed others
Clarity now removes Fear since it's mostly visual to the player and Clarity also refers to mental clarity
You can no longer go into flight if Stunned (if you're Stunned while not in flight)
Experimenting with using the Tessellator for rendering Directed Lightning
Removed the Inkling from the Nether and the End
Refactored the biome class to use the TragicBiome superclass instead (similarly to how I did the potions)
Changed all biomes to use their variant field to set their generation values, this is to clean up their initializations
Added Giant Zombie spawn egg to my mob eggs, modified egg names for Vanilla mobs to ensure that people know they are the Vanilla vesions and not special versions
Small fix to Reach again
Fixed item challenges that should ignore meta values
Added more variation to biome variation heights, modified some biome set rainfall and humidity values
Fixed being able to use the Flight potion effect while under the effects of Stun
Fixed chest not generating with loot in an Obsidian Cavern variant
Fixed Surface structures not generating properly due to safe zone checks being applied to them meant for non-Surface structures

2.43.2469 <202> (May 7, 2015) 
Small fix to Minotaur/Apis charging, they now rotate to where they are charging
Reduced area that Apis Temples clear for generation
Fixed Obsidian Caverns only generating with one type of cavern offering
Removed Amplified effect from SpikeGen, it makes them generate larger and taller but it also creates huge amounts of lag, so this is being removed in favor
of improving overall loading times
Fixed entity recognition for certain challenge types, specifically killing a high up superclass (like EntityLivingBase) counting for entities that extend
multiple others (i.e. EntityStinKing -> EntityGreaterStin -> EntityStin -> TragicMob -> EntityMob -> EntityCreature -> EntityLiving -> EntityLivingBase)
Added Tox/Pox/Magmox sounds
Added Stin/Baby Stin/Greater Stin/Stin King/Stin Queen sounds, added teleport sound
Changed name of Wisp to Kindling Spirit to avoid confusion with Wisps from other mods, improved Wisp particle effect recognition (based on biome)
Made it so that Bosses spawning on Easy is configurable
Nerfed the Range enchantment some (reduced amount of extra range given per enchant level)
Increased Range level on the Sword of Justice and Titan to compensate for the nerf
Added Cryse/Mega Cryse/Star-Vox/Vox Stellarum sounds
Added Nor-Vox sounds
Increased frequency of the Plague's living sounds (how often they do their sound, not sound frequency)
Added Kindling Spirit (Wisp) sounds, they now take damage when in water (don't know why they didn't before)
Added some Gui sounds, as well as some of the Doomsday confirmation sounds and Item use sounds
Added Item Use sounds to the Amulet Release, Doom Consume and Cooldown Defuse
Added Sound net messages in order to send doomsday success/failures to the client from the Doom use message handler
Fixed derps with client-side only messages
Fixed Tall Grass and a few other blocks dropping Spirit Casts
Added Directed Lightning sounds, these are under the weather category
Added Nano Swarm sounds
Added Harvester sounds, using chest open sound for when it releases a nano swarm
Added Lockbot sounds, still need a lockdown sound for it (when it attaches a lock to an entity)
Added Hunter sounds, a drone-y sound that goes higher pitched when it is attacking something
Added Seeker sound, it only plays when it's targetting something, it gains volume/pitch while gazing at them until it loses sight of them long enough or
it kills them
Slight modification done to Directed Lightning sounds

2.44.2560 <203> (May 13, 2015) [Major Doomsday cleanup, Amulets changed to be server and client-side, lots of new content for both]
Set up adding all of the new Doomsdays, Amulets and Structures
Planned a large amount of random Achievements but still need to add the "plotline" ones
Important change to Amulets was done, so that effects would be done on client and server side, this was done to make the Spider Amulet work but will most
likely be done to sync Doomsday Effects as well
Added Spider Amulet ability
Added Stin Amulet ability
Fixed derp up on Piercing amulet ability
Added Polaris Amulet ability
Added Overlord Amulet ability
Added Lightning Amulet ability
Added Consumption Amulet ability, fixed derp with backlash giving you Doom instead of taking it
Added Supernatural Amulet ability
Added Undead Amulet ability
Added Ender Dragon Amulet ability
Added Fusea Amulet ability
Added Luck Amulet ability
This should be the last of the Amulets as I decided I didn't like some of the last few effects (and this is a lot added already)
Added all of the new Amulet recipes, added them to the Chest Hooks
Added Amulets to Luxury boss drops (Only regular Amulets), added Amulet drops to the Overlord Core (can drop Cursed and regular Amulets)
Added Septics Doomsday, added Septic Gas for it, which is basically a temporary version of Radiated Gas
Added Life Share Doomsday
Added Kurayami, still need the Kurayami entity to make it actually functional, but currently I'm going to make it at least strong enough to take out a few
Iron Golems, will despawn after an amount of time that depends on the Overflow amount it it summoned with, it'll use a more aggressive form of the Kitsunakuma's
AI/attack patterns but it will take damage like a normal mob
Added feature along with a config option to enable/disable dropping all Amulets on death
Drops for flowers/leaves now stop the block from being dropped to avoid easy farming
Changed Tough Leather recipe again to require two leathers
Added Death Mark Doomsday
Added Paradigm Shift Doomsday
Did some adjustments to iterations for various Doomsdays (affects how often they update per second and how many times they'll update in total)
Increased time it takes to mine a Summon block (this will be used for an Achievement)
Added Adrenaline Doomsday
Added more localized terms for Doomsdays, made confirmation message and crucial moment messages automatic on use
Added static methods for displaying crucial moment and no entity in range messages
Cleaned up all current Doomsday classes, removed a lot of redundancies within them
Modified Guardian physics a bit, they now get removed when they don't have an owner (since I can't get them to save their owner ID)
Changed how Nature Drain works, it now heals you slowly and only "drains" the plantlife around you when it runs out of drained energy
Added Escape Doomsday
Added Gift of the Gods Doomsday
Added Gambler Doomsday
Added Psygote sounds
Added Archangel sounds
Added Soulstealer Doomsday
Added Parasite Doomsday
Added Symbiosis Doomsday, it is a Combination Doomsday of Parasite and Fear
Added Time Collapse Doomsday
Increased DoomsdayList size for more Doomsdays
Removed Combinations set from the DoomsdayManager, instead check if a Doomsday is extended and returns a non-null combination (both required to start a 
combination)
Added Soul Chest sound when a mob soul is given to it, this is under block sounds
Added various Challenge start sounds, added Challenge end sound, these are experimental
Fixed find Entity challenges, fixed kill Entity game crash
Redid Plague sounds, they were a bit annoying so I made them a bit more subtle, lowered overall volume
Redid Minotaur sounds, they have a bit more variety and sound better and also fixed derp with it's hoof sounds
Lowered overall volume of Pumpkinhead
Changed Light material to circuits
Small change to boss render bars
Added Amulet colors for the new batch of Amulets, adjusted some of the colors for the older ones
Fixed Overlord Amulet not being an Epic Amulet
Changed the Luck attribute to affect entity xp on death, similarly to the Luck Amulet, their effects stack
Added Fusea/Volatile Fusea sounds
Fixed typos with a couple of the other sounds
Added Magnetizer Doomsday
Added Ambience Doomsday, this will form a combination with Decay to create Radiant Light
Lightning Rush now requires Light Shove to be used while Titanfall is active instead of Ravage, this is so that Ravage is opened up for a future combination
that makes more sense
Added Dimentia Doomsday, it is a combination of Harmonizer and Asphyxiate (two polar opposite Doomsdays)
Added Delete Doomsday, it uses a vector to delete multiple blocks in a line
Added Laser Cutter Doomsday, uses the vector system that the Delete Doomsday uses but mines slowly and is an extended Doomsday
Cut the Petal Dance Doomsday, may change it up and add it later
Added Danger Zone Doomsday, it is a combination of Suicidal Tendencies and Ravage
Moved getDistanceToGround to WorldHelper and made it static, use it in Doomsdays that spawn things in the sky
Added Support Doomsday, it gives the Doom that you use to activate it to other players near you
Added Purify Doomsday, removes all potion effects from all entities and extinguishes them if they are on fire
Fix crash from config options for Doomsdays
Made Doomsday Scrolls in the Creative Tab work more efficiently (it uses the Doomsday list rather than the names so that spotting errors with them is easier)
Fixed derps with config regarding the Radiant Light
Modified Danger Zone to not create as much lag
Added Recall Doomsday
Added Kurayami mob for the Kurayami Doomsday, it uses slightly modified code from the Kitsunakuma but is categorized as a Golem
Modified Iron Golem and Snow Golem entity eggs to be categorized as Pets, same thing was done for the Kurayami egg
Fixed crash due to entity attributes for the Kurayami
Updated some aspects of the Kitsune AI, it now teleports when in water and it's navigator now avoids water
Kitsunakuma vs Kurayami now works in such a way that they will fight each other (and do damage to each other) but the battle will be weighed towards the Kitsune
since it is a Boss
Adjusted Kurayami's animations to fit it's longer attack time
Added Shuffle Doomsday
Added Blink Doomsday
Fixed some lag with the recent Nature Drain changes
Added Evacuate Doomsday, it is a combination of Shuffle and Blink
Added Medic Doomsday
Added Resurgence Doomsday (Soul Link will be added another time), it is a combination of Support and Medic

2.44.2602 <204> (May 22, 2015)
Modified Plague and Harvester sounds to play on update rather than using the vanilla living sound thing
Added Ranmas sounds (uses the Harvester and the Vanilla Anvil sounds)
Added Erkel sounds (uses very high-pitched versions of the Tox sounds)
Added Ire sounds
Added Sirv sounds
Added Parasmite sounds
Added Abomination sounds
Added Aegar sounds
Added laser particles for the Aegar's laser attacks
Added Polaris sounds
Added Kitsunakuma & Kurayami sounds
Reduced amount of particles that the Aegar spawns
Removed variation in the Kitsunakuma & Kurayami's fireball accuracy, it's the main way to attack it by deflecting it back to it and that doesn't work so well when
it doesn't shoot it accurately at it's target
Added Veteran Enchantment, it had been planned for a long time and so I finally added it now, it breaks blocks around the one you mined (comparable to the
special tool types in Tinkerer's Construct), it doesn't combine with Silk Touch or Combustion
Added Veteran to the Celestial Jack, this replaces Combustion for it
Improved description splitter for various items by using an ArrayList instead of keeping it as an array
Made superclasses for the Bow and Tool classes that I use, this is to simplify checks for Doomsdays and to simplify the lore description process for them
Improved Veteran block mining, it'll now properly check if the block is breakable (not a -1 hardness level) and if the tool is efficient against it (greater than 1
break speed)
Combustion now needs to be effective against the block it breaks in order to smelt it
Improved Unbreakable so that it doesn't break blocks when it isn't supposed to, there's also a buffer for Veteran so that it doesn't break while that is also
on the Tool
Added default Lore when an item fails to find an appropriate Lore (which shouldn't happen but is there just in case)
Fixed derp with description splitter, it now actually splits the lines in the proper order and splits more than one time
Made it so that weapons cannot update lores on the client-side and result in null Lores being picked even if one is displayed to the player
Doing a mass cleanup now, standby for huge GitHub update
Fixed derp with GuiDoom (wrong class cast)
Experimenting with adding custom music for the Dimensions
Allow client-side effects to apply per tick rather than every other tick, this should improve efficiency of them and some effects that would stop when the
game was paused (Disorientation, Fear, Stun) now continue their effect correctly
Fixed render overlays making it impossible to see when the vanilla portal effect is applied at the same time, fixed derp up that made it impossible for players
to travel to different dimensions when not in Creative
Fixed crash when not in game yet for Amulets
Added sounds for the Dimensions, currently using Metroid Prime tracks for placeholders (may keep them, who knows)
Reverted fix to overlay making it impossible to see, it happens too rarely to really bother with anyway
Rerecorded Polaris sonar/death/clone sounds
Modified experience values for each mob/boss, bosses had their overall xp amounts lowered by a lot, the Overlord now drops XP on each form's death
Made Apis harder by increasing default armor and attack damage
Made Empariah harder by increasing it's default attack damage and making it's attacks get used more often where they make the most sense
Fixed some small animation bugs with the Empariah
Slightly increased Time Controller's default armor
Increased Enyvil's default armor by a little bit
Lowered the default damage cap by 5, max damage is 25 now to bosses by default
Increased Apis, Claymation and Polaris default speed values
Lowered Time Controller's speed value a bit
Fixed bug with Claymation when one of it's forms was killed, it would update onDeath but not actually be dead

2.44.2646 <205> (June 2, 2015)
Added the rest of the Skultar sounds
Statues now rotate towards the player when they are placed
Reduced range in which statues apply collision to players, collision is applied on server and client side now
Added an experimental item, Anomaly Augment, it gives you a random item (out of any in the game currently) based on the Enchantments you apply to it, only up to 5 attempts per enchant use
Adding another experimental item, a Nuke, just for fun, may or may not be in the release version, who knows
Added a beep and a faded beep, these will most likely be multipurpose but I'm gonna use them for the nuke sound effect for now
Added recipes for the Anomaly Augment and Nuke, added configurability of whether those two items are enabled (since they both can be pretty game-breaking)
Added textures for the Anomaly and Nuke, also added a model for the Nuke entity with a basic texture
Capped Gragul and Kragul's damage to do a minimum amount, this means it can kill you with less health easier
Increased blast size of the Nuke, added description to the Anomaly Augment
Fixed bug with Structures generating on the Nether roof
Reduced amount of particles created from the Nuke, the Nuke now remembers what stage and how much time it's been in that stage when you reload a world,
this is to prevent ppl from using it then reloading to preserve the Nuke (although doing so now desyncs the client and server side of it, it's not important enough to care about)
Updated Forge in workspace and refreshed dependencies, going to probably do a full clean sometime soon
Added the Avris mob with it's mostly complete AI, still need to add it's model, animations and texture
Added Time Controller sounds
Converted IExtendedDoomsday to have two methods instead of it just being a marker interface, removed unnecessary fields from Instant Doomsdays
Updated Forge in workspace, for some reason it didn't do it last time I updated it
Fixed sound extrapolator not working on my multipart entities
Separated the Doom recharge rate and recharge amounts, this allows for more configurability
Changed how recharge rate is used, clamped to amounts that would be most plausible
Fixed bug with Vanilla music playing at the same time as mine in the Dimensions
The Overlord boss instance is extremely laggy currently due to the dimension being so framerate intensive, so we'll do more optimizations for that and hopefully
get it up to playable levels (currently it is settling at ~15 fps for me, but I have no graphics card so the CPU is doing all of the work)
Created a completely new Circuit World generator for the Synapse, this should increase load times and make it look better overall
Reduced radius that the MusicTicker looks for the Overlord Core
Slight increase to velocity of arrows fired from Celestial Longbow
Added exception handling for the MusicTicker causing crashes for unloaded chunks
Added ability to right-click amulets into your amulet inventory
Fixed client-side crashes from newer netcode
Fixed Kurayami spawning in with 0 health, killing it immediately
Truncated location for message from Death Mark Doomsday
Reduced amount of hunger that Symbiosis causes
Fixed bug with right-clicking amulets that would put them in locked slots
Reduced amount of iterations that Shuffle does
Modified Overlord Core and Archangel movement to use their attribute values
Fixed bug with Piercing Amulet causing endless looping, fixed multiple bugs with this server-side
Fixed bug with Amulets appearing in the inventory even if they aren't actually there, updated inventory code to markDirty on any damage changes and to set the
stack size to 0 if the item durability is at 0
This should fix multiple inventory ghosting bugs that could occur, there's still a bug when clicking on a slot and moving an amulet to another one that leaves
a ghost stack but clicking on that will remove it
Improved Aqua Superiority and Flight on the client-side (you move faster now)
Saturation now removes Hunger if both are active
Fixed Iron Golem Amulet applying durability damage too quickly
Fixed Snow Golem Amulet applying durability damage client-side and too quickly
Fixed Ender Dragon Amulet breaking the wrong blocks due to offset
Fixed Undead Amulet causing you to burn too much on the client-side
Improved Stin Amulet's ability to knockback targets
Fixed Lightning Amulet not setting the right hunger values to restore hunger
Did server testing for the Nuke, doesn't lag the server at all so that's awesome

2.44.2686 <206> (June 15, 2015)
Added Synapse variants to the Dimension, there will be dead sectors and corrupt sectors, these act like mini-biomes and will be done via worldgen instead
of by using a normal biome generation method
The 3x3 chunks around 0,0 are protected from being variants
Tower structures no longer generate in the Synapse, I will add Synapse specific structures soon
Reduced default chance for Synapse mini-biomes to generate
Removed Wither from the Corrupted Spire spawners (unless certain mini-bosses are disabled)
Fixed hole not generating properly in boss floors of Corrupted Spires
Ice spikes can be silk touch harvested now
Created a method for firing projectiles for any of my mobs, this does all of the usual calculations and will adjust for entity motion if on Hard, some issues
with getting it to register a player's motion for some reason
Reduced amount of spores that Tox fire
Apis will now alternate between reflecting and not reflecting instead of just randomly reflecting, this will make it more difficult to fight
Removed Strength buff from Golden Sushi
Modified method for projectile firing to allow for vanilla fireballs and wither skulls to be used
Added Overlord Cocoon sounds, working on the Combat and Core form sounds
Cocoon form now only summons in Nano Swarms on later phases, it's corrupted gas now spawns in a larger area as well when vulnerable
Going to use the same vulnerable sounds for all 3 forms so that the player knows when they are vulnerable, but slightly pitch shifted
Added multiple Combat form sounds, working on Core sounds now
Added multiple new flowers specifically for the Collision
Changed the ItemBlock that the flowers and saplings use, my flowers now extend blockbush instead of blockflower
Did some fixes for smaller spikes generating in the Decaying and Starlit biomes, they should now generate less staggered and cubic
Added new flower worldgen for the Collision, this will run alongside the other one (but shouldn't cause any hangs)
Removed a few older flowers from generation in the Collision
Fixed Molten Rock being insta-mined due to the hardness never being set
Teleporter now will always clear a spot to spawn you in whenever you go to either of my Dimensions
Slightly reduced efficiency of the Jacks/Scythes to allow for a bit more room to work with regarding future upgrades for them
Experimented with Fruit block, possibly to add some type of food to the Collision
Tested Ascension levels and some future potion effects
Fixed MusicTicker playing when music is disabled (muted)
Added Sky Fruit block, will work similarly to Cocoa, working on more food sources for the Dimension
Increased spike size variation in Crystal biomes, experimented with changing overall spike sizes in the world generator
Fixed derp with spikegen (doing no regression on larger spikes)
Fixed derp with vine generation (not properly using the generation resulting in no vines being generated)
Fixed another derp with vine gen not using the block that is saved in it
Added reed-like crops for the collision, this involves a crop version of the Nasty and Exotic Fruits
Moved the reed and crop blocks to Creative tab, these are not obtainable in Survival and probably shouldn't even be in the Creative tabs
Added unripened textures and made it so that the reed has to be partially matured to give food, they can be grown with bone meal now as well
Added a few more flowers just to total it up to 16 for that block, another one can be created if necessary anyway
Reduced area that the Cocoon form clears, made it so that it only clears a hemisphere as well
Added recipes for the newest group of flowers added
Made certain mobs immune to being affected by Quicksand
Finished up the Claymation Ruins, one of the most awesome structures I've made
Fixed a few initial bugs with worldgen with the Ruins regarding properly clearing air space on the entrance tunnel and ensuring that the stairway down
to the actual ruins can go down to a far enough y level depending on how high the generation is started

2.44.2716 <207> (July 3, 2015)
Modified Structure Seeds block/item to automatically update when new ones were added
Improved memory use during claymation ruin generation, this sped it up a tiny bit but was mostly meant for when the world was being generated, going to go
through and optimize more of the worldgen code again
Added Avris to the Collision's spawns, still need it's model stuff done
Reduced speed of Overlord Core's flight
Added Dark Hut structure, reduced chance of Time Altar generating, increased chance of Soul Tomb generating
Added Corsin blocks, texture influenced by Metroid for the Spider Nest structure, due to how I textured the Corsin blocks, it'll be a Dark Forest structure
Added Corsin block recipes to convert from the base ones to the others (like for the other aesthetic blocks I have)
Fixed Deathglow and Honeydrop being generated with a meta value of 0
Renamed Exotic Fruit and Nasty Fruit to their plant names, the blocks now have (Plant) appended to them to differentiate, Gooey Fruit will remain Gooey Fruit
and the item recipes to create these fruits will be removed
Finished up the Spider Nest, it generates as a large disc-like room with webs, chests and stin spawners in it
Added the Memory Cache, it'll generated randomly in the Synapse (only depends on starting coordinate location, not on what blocks are near it
Added the Hacker Net, it randomly generates Digital Sea with Hunter spawners and decent chests, for the Synapse
Added the Light Spire, it generates a mostly vertical column of String Light, which has Archangel spawners and sometimes chests
Added the newest structures to the config, have one more structure (the outlook) and then I'm done with structures for now
Removed enforced buffer for Celestial Temple, it can now actually generate
Reduced Corrupted Spire to 15 floors instead of 20 to reduce lag, also optimized some small bits of memory use to help reduce lag further
Corrupted Spire now generates in ~7 seconds instead of ~18 seconds, so that's a major improvement
Added utility property for various things (mostly with special potion effects)
Used the utility property to finally remove the terrible CommonProxy hashmap I had for Corruption radiation
Did some testing for another new potion effect, went well so that'll be in use later on
Fixed some issues with Corruption's radiation aspect, you now must be isolated from other living entities in order to remove the corruption (if it's effect
time runs out, it'll still remove as normal, but this lets you remove it quicker and without possibly corrupting other entities around you)
Finished a new structure, an experimental 3D maze, generates out of obsidian to encourage actually doing the maze but otherwise allows you to mine into/out of
it in case it doesn't generate in such a way to allow you to get to the treasure room (or if you find the treasure room but can't get out)
Created a seperate Structure WorldGen to fix that bug with generating structures 10,000 blocks away
Previous change to Structure WorldGen did nothing to fix the bug (actually made it worse lol) so I reverted that change
It's possibly doing the bug during chunk populating, which may be an issue with the vanilla server manager
Need to look into the chunk generation for my Dimension more to see what's going on with that stuff
Looked into the gen layers and determined that the cause is due to zooming in so far on the biome gen layer (for larger biome sizes) but since that isn't
really something I can fix, it'll have to stay until I experiment more with the Gen Layers
GenLayers were modified some so previous worlds will now have ugly world chunk borders (oh well)
Added a placeholder for the Outlook, it'll be a randomized surface pillar that goes up to y = 220, it'll generate with a large platform that'll have lots of
treasures but it will have a singular pillar with a ladder to go all the way up to the top (so if you don't have Flight, it'll take you a while to get there)
Went through and optimized memory use for most of the WorldGen, fixed some initial bugs with this transition
Painted Trees (the normal ones, not the 2x2 ones) now may generate with Sky Fruit pods on them
Config potion ids now get set as one group instead of being set in groups (positive and negative), this is to prevent them from breaking if I add a new one, 
so now they are done together one after the other such that new effects are added to the end instead of the middle (if they are "positive" effects)

2.44.2746 <208> (July 13, 2015)
Pushed a massive commit to Git, due to me working on and off on this for the past month or so, I haven't gotten around to pushing commits so I'll try to get
back on doing that more often
Finished up the Outlook of Persistence, skeleton spawners every 50 blocks up it and a large platform with a Soul Chest and Enderman spawners at the top
Soul Chests now open for Creative mode players without requiring souls to be fulfilled
Removed most info logging, left in a few for debug purposes to be removed later (before release)
Fixed bug with Synapse chunk generation
Mobs can now specify their drop amounts (maybe larger/tougher mobs could drop more things)
Increased Boss drop amounts (for their normal drops, not "luxury" drops)
Added Enyvil sounds
Improved Enyvil AI a little bit, it should use slam more often
Removed current render for Directed Lightning, it was causing too much distraction
Added Overlord Core sounds, going to rerecord the normal living and the roar sounds since I don't like how they turned out
Increased how long Dimensional Anomolies stay alive
Modified how Corruption change is handled, you can now spawn an entity with a change state of 1 in order to change it immediately, now also does explosion particles so that
it isn't an instant change
Added a sound when a mob has a corrupted change
Added sounds for Dimensional Anomalies to make them easier to locate
Rerecorded some of the Overlord Core sounds, I'll do more later on
Derped up potion effects when I changed the config, fixed now
Made Corruption damage more consistent
Added a visual status effect for burned, this might seem a bit redundant but it'll be toggle-able and will default to disabled, meant to display how long you have been burned for
Fixed Fear playing way too many sounds at once
Added color randomization to Divinity's overlay effect, this is configurable
Updated normal mob memory use for small things like texture and variant ids
Fixed bug with Time Controller's Quantum Leap ability that mixed up your yaw and pitch values
Fixed bug with variant drops not dropping after a few kills
Fixed derp on a Magmox datawatcher
Slightly modified Tox and Pox drops, Tox now can only drop Exotic Fruit and Pox can now drop Sky Fruit
Fixed Erkel's death sound
Modified potion/biome/enchantment ids to automatically check through the entire list of ids once, if no id is found through that check then the default value is used regardless of if
it is a free slot, this should never be an issue, especially since I increased the size of the potion array even more but should still be done in case of larger modpacks
Added verification for the mob stat arrays to ensure that they are correct on config load
Messed with adding StructureBoundingBoxes to my Structures so that they don't interfere with each other but I'll probably do all of that in the StructureWorldGen class and use the
world storage to keep track of them (this is to prevent structures from generating on or very near each other)
Workspace updated to Windows 10 so my recording software isn't working properly for me to finish Boss sounds
Doing a test build now to ensure that everything is working up to this point

2.44.2776 <209> (August 5, 2015)
Rebalanced Suicidal Tendencies some, it is now actually worth using over spamming rockets normally
Fixed Fanbrush and Tangleweed textures not working properly after build (capitalization errors on texture strings)
Fixed improper imports being used for Arrays
Fixed Neko Launcher and IreNet Particle Cannon not properly checking for Doom global cooldown on use
Fixed error with id handling for potions, potions store their id locally so that the automated id search doesn't break
Added config option to disable Digital Sea generation in the Synapse
Modified Enchantment configs to use the same system that Potion configs use, since they both used similar methods previously, also fixed bug with the armor enchant configs never
being set properly resulting in them being always disabled
Fixed rarities never being applied to the ItemStack display name (at some point I removed this during a rewrite and never reimplemented it)
Basically removed all Skultar & Overlord Core sounds (except the Scythe attacking sound), I ended up not liking what I recorded and I'll probably do a release before I get a
chance to rerecord them
Added the Avris model/texture and basic render, added particle effects and adjusted the Avris's size, may go back and improve the animations but for now it uses very simple animations
as it is just supposed to run away from players
Modified Sirv model to be a biped, modified TragicNeko animations a little bit
Adjusted Sirv attack animations and added sitting animation for when it's in a minecart
Modified Avris model to be biped and adjusted animations accordingly, added sitting animation
Fix mob spawners not working in cube mazes
Working on porting the mod up to 1.8, there's tons of errors but I've resolved most of them (only about 3000 left...)
Made it so that Claymation Ruins may only generate below y = 80, this is to reduce lag from them generating at a really high y value
Still working on the mod port, down to around 1200 errors and I still need to do the json files for the blocks and items (why are there so many items and blocks DDDDD;)
Setup Structures to use BlockPos to ease port to 1.8, this will make it possible to add new structures in future updates without the huge amount of work to port it
Fixed Dark Lightning and Enyvil using the top block instead of the closest surface to summon lightning
Fixed Dimensional Keys using durability even when you don't teleport
Added doom kill recharge, each mob you kill restores a certain amount of doom (this will be disabled by default), the amount is the normal recharge amount if recovery is enabled
Adjusted biome genlayers again to hopefully fix structures generating thousands of blocks away
Added debug for signs and spawners when generated by a structure
Fixed Amulet blanket config not properly setting the other configs to false
Added final fields in the config to make it easier to determine which blanket config is which
Fixed max Doom not resetting to proper minimum value after being set to a lower value in a previous save, also set max Doom to lower value if the player hasn't ever upgraded their
Doom via a Doom Consume
Fixed some entities not being registered when mobs were disabled in config
Added config option to disable mob sounds, these only affect the custom ones I recorded and any vanilla ones I use will stay for the mobs
Reduced how long you are Withered when you drink Bone Marrow
Adjust target filtering for the Dark Lightning projectile
Added missing sound for the config filter on my mob sounds
Only register server tick events if ire is allowed in config
Removed some fruit from various leaf drops due to addition of growable fruits
Removed Disappearing and Active Digital Sea blocks
Added EntityAI for burning entities via daylight (and brightness)
Reverted 1.7 BlockPos addition, it is no longer required due to how I ended up doing schematic conversion in 1.8
Fixed Overlord Core roar sound still playing, added sound when a Tragic Neko drops a cluster bomb
Removed Nuke and Anomaly Augment, keeping nuke entity to possibly readd in the future
Added Birthday celebrations for Tragic Nekos, they do not attack and do not use any rockets/bombs, when right-clicked with cake or tnt they spawn fireworks
Added sound for when a Tragic Neko drops a bomb on death (uses creeper fizz sound)

2.44.2776B
Fixed Aegar not dropping Synapse Links

2.45.2776++ <210> (September 3, 2015) [Completely revamp the Config, added more options and categories for it, it is easier, better, faster, stronger...]
Fixed Apis "sliding" when using it's stomp attack
Modified Titan's Lightning Strike ability to use the updated one from the 1.8 port
Working on improving the config and setting up some master configs other than mobsOnly mode, hardcore mode has a lot of the easy-mode options disabled and has things scaled in a very
unforgiving manner, including mob health and doomsday costs, lightweight mode has a lot of the risk removed from doing stuff in the mod and most mobs have their health and damage debuffed
from normal
Rewriting the config will take a while, then I'll port it over to the 1.8 version
Added new Damage Sources
Ensure that Doom doesn't regenerate while the player still has cooldown
Removed some unnecessary config options, reorganized options into more distinct categories, added more options for various categories
Reorganized the config itself to be faster and also easier to read
Added and set up new master configs, finally more alongside mobsOnly mode
Finished refactoring to new config, setting up new options that were added
Removed PotionBleed class, it'll be an anonymous class when it's actually added, meanwhile I need to set up the generator item stuff
Fixed critical issue with new config (null properties due to getting them from the category not setting them up, this just requires me to refactor them a bit)
Fixed a few initial bugs with copy-pasta (derp)
Fixed a few initial bugs with some of the new master configs, these need to be more thoroughly tested but otherwise are holding up pretty well
Fixed ID offsets for Biomes, Enchantments and Potions in the config, derp
Rebalanced Disorientation, higher amplifier causes higher degrees of twitch, base amplifier is no longer unbearable twitch
While preparing to add the last few achievements and their triggers, started planning the next Alpha's AI
For mob-specific achievements I'll add in special boolean variables to keep track, this'll mean in multiplayer that anyone can deactivate the achievement but
only the one who kills the mob fulfilling the condition will get the achievement (most ppl play in single-player anyway, but this also ensures teamwork is required if multiplayer)
Started adding some stuff for next expansion, not going to be in next release, just prepping

TODO still:
Finish recording sounds:
-Sound for when a Tragic Neko drops or throws a grenade
-Sound for when a rocket is fired either by a Tragic Neko or by a player
-Sounds for various projectiles, either firing them or giving them ambient sounds
-Sound for when the Overlord Cocoon form is damaged enough or not during it's instance
-Rerecord Overlord Core and Skultar sounds, didn't like the first attempts
-Apis sounds: Mad bull sounds
-Yeti sounds: Deep beastly sounds
-Claymation sounds: soppy, clay sounds as normal form, uses other mob's sounds when transformed
-Avris sounds: oohs and ahhs and snickers... mmm snickers
